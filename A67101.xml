            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Books are almoſt innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble occaſion'd by an unhappy He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, that in the last age infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Germany, and after like a Leproſy, Overſpread the greatest part of our Northen Countries. Too many are writ by Thoſe, who ſtile themſelves Proteſtants, or of the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, not to ſpeak of the Subdiviſions as Arminians, Browniſts, Anabaptiſts, or of their Followers, which crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into as many Sects as men. Of Theſe we have VVri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who with no little Animoſity inveigh bitterly one againſt an other. Yet (becauſe Self-intereſt will have it ſo) All of them cloſely joyn in a Foul dishonorable Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue againſt an Ancient Mother Church That made them and their Progenitors Christians.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:102687:2"/>
            <p>This hath ſtirr'd up the pen of many a learned man, not ſo much to confute their weak Diſcourſes, as poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to Aſſert Truth which cannot be ſhaken, and to Vndeceive a poor ſort of ſeduced People, who eaſily gain'd by ſleek VVords and the Specious Pretenſes of ſome (who have told untruth ſo long, that at laſt they almoſt Believe it Themſelves) inſenſibly fall into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. To Vnbeguile theſe deluded Souls more, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve here caſt my Mite alſo into the Treaſury of theſe learned labours, and writ this Treatiſe. VVherin I both lay forth the Evidence of our Roman Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion upon undoubted Grounds, and make it likewiſe manifest That Proteſtancy, as Reformed, which is only a fallible taught Doctrin, cannot be Reſolved into Gods Infallible Revelation, and therſore is no part of Christian Religion, But a meer Opinion only Vpheld by Fancy.</p>
            <p>I undertook the ſmall work you here ſe upon this occaſion. About a year ſince, (ſo much it was when I writ this Preface) A friend ſent me a Book with a ſurly imperious Title. The Nullity of the Romiſh Faith; or a blow at the root of the Romiſh Church. By M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Matthew Poole printed anno 1666. and only deſired me to make a few Obſervations upon an Appendix by the ſame Author againſt a Converted Gentleman. Curioſity ledd me on to read the whole
<pb facs="tcp:102687:2"/> book, where finding little worth the Anſwering, I laid it aſide for two or three months, till I was urged again to return ſome ſhort Anſwer to the Appendix. But while this buſines gave me a little entertainment, VVe here (though at diſtance) Heard a noiſe of a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Account of the Grounds of Proteſtant Religion <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Edward Stillingfleet. The book I ſaw but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet ſome Parcels of his Doctrin found the way to me by ſeveral Reports, and Letters alſo. VVerupon, I laid M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Pooles Appendix aſide And was longer in this Treatiſe then I intended, or was indeed neceſſary to Anſwer the Appendix, which yet may have an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer timely enough.</p>
            <p>By the way, as far as ſure Principles can Guide one, and a few Glances at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Pooles Doctrin will reach to, I refute ſome weak ground's of His Nullity, which is as much as it deſerves. That of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Stillingfleet Merit's more, I mean a larger Refutation. Though to ſpeak Truth, it is too tediouſly long and both ſayes very much, and very little: Much in Generalities and cavilling at our Catholick Faith, But little in giving any Account of Proteſtant Religion as 'tis now reformed, which yet was the only Thing I ſought for, but found not in his writings, as I have often noted in this Treatiſe. Had I had his book ſooner, or more time, I would have refuted ſome more chief points in it, but I hope Thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:102687:3"/> have it in hand, that will bring the Author to a better account; for he who first Tell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s amiſs muſt count twice, before He make a Right reckoning.</p>
            <p>I wave all along, as much as may be, an unneceſſary Repetition of known Authorities drawn from Scripture, and Fathers (for that were <hi>Actum agere</hi>) and endeavor to ground my Diſcours upon undoubted Principles. And my chief aym is, as I novv inſinuated, to make it evident, That Proteſtancy built upon Fancy, ſtand's tottering vvithout the Support oſ any acknovvledged Principles, and conſequently Fall's of it ſelf. To ſpeak more plainly: VVhen Sectaries go about, either to impugn the Roman Catholick Doctrin, or to eſtabliſh their Ovvn, They give you nothing that look's like a ſure ovvned Principle, but quite contrary, tire you out vvith long loos Diſcourſes, which driven on to the very laſt, at moſt come to no more but to Gueſses only, vveak Conjectures, and the unproved Thoughts of thoſe vvho make them. In a vvord, They never fall on Principles, nor can make their own Doctrin good upon any better Argument then by only ſaying, It is True, or cavilling at ours: As if't were the way for a man to Prove Himfelf honeſt, by ſaying his neighbour is not ſo; or enough to Eſtabliſh Their Houſe built upon ſand to Aſſert that ours, once certainly ſetled on a Rock, is not Th' an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient building it was but hath been repayr'd, and otherwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Adorn'd. If all this were true (as it is moſt fals) what's
<pb facs="tcp:102687:3"/> their Houſe the better, that's ſtill upon ſand? Or, their Religion ſounder, that ſtand's Vnprincipl'd without Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Church, or Reaſon? I only ſay thus much in a Preface, and prove it afterward in the following Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which I was adviſed to write in Latin, having now more uſe of That (I may thank my long Abſence from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land for it) then is allowed me of our Mother Tongue. But <hi>ſapientibus &amp; inſipientibus debitor ſum.</hi> I deſire to ſatisfy all, and owe as much to the Illiterate of my dear Country as to the Learned, and therfore ſhall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this Treatiſe in plain Engliſh (for I can ſpeak no better) and hope upon that Account to find the Readers eaſier Pardon If I often Speak improperly, or now and then break Priſcians head in Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Sometimes as the matter requires, I am forc'd to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke uſe of words that may ſeem harſh as Toyes, Fancies, Trifles not worth the Anſvvering &amp;c. But 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to uſe other language, if I'll call things by their right names, and give the vvorld to underſtand vvhat they are, Smoother termes would look like Mockery (whilſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries uſe harſher) rather then Civility. Believe what you will. I Profeſs ſeriouſly, all I ſay is without Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or Deſign to reflect Perſonally upon our Adverſaries whom I pitty and pray for, having no intention to reproach them, but to Reprove Hereſy, To rail at any, but to convince by Reaſon.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:102687:4"/>
            <p>But I keep you too long at the Door, open and read without Prejudice, and if you be not ſatisfied with what I write, of Charity give me timely notice, for my dayes are almoſt Don. In the other world I can make no Anſwer but to Almighty God, for the ſincerity of my undertaking: wherby if any one ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le reap benefit, I have enough; if none do ſo, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is, that He who knowes my good intention will be my ample Recompence, though infinitly above my deſert,</p>

            <head>A NECESSARY ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE READER.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ay it pleas Any one to read this Treatiſe, And either ſeek to profit by it, or vouchſafe to return an Anſwer, He will I hope, after a general thought, caſt on what I intend to prove in the enſuing Diſcourſes, take particular Notice alſo of a few Notes here ſet down which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps conduce to His better ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning the firſt. We need not to ſay much. My Intent is Chiefly to prove Theſe four Things. 1. That Sectaries are Churchles, becauſe They acknowledge no infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Church on earth. Yet there are Infallible Teachers (and conſequently an infallible Church) as is Demonſtrated in the firſt Diſcours. 2. That
<pb facs="tcp:102687:5"/> They are as Scriptureles as Churchles, and have not one ſyllable of Gods Word for Proteſtancy. Therfore we treat in the ſecond Diſcours of Their mangling and miſinterpreting Scripture. 3. That Their Proceeding is moſt Vnreaſonable in ſome chief controverſies handled in the third Diſcours. 4. We prove in the fourth Diſcours, the Roman Catholick Church to be the only true <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> And there alſo lay Forth the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability of Proteſtant Religion. All this is Don to make good what the Title briefly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes. <hi>Viz Proteſtancy is vvithout Principles of Scripture, Church and Reaſon.</hi> Now a word of what I would have you to Note.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is truly lamentable, to ſe how contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies in theſe our dayes are driven on to nothing but to endles quarrels. There is certainly ſome cauſe of ſo long a work, which might, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, be brought to a period with leſs Adoe. And what is it, think ye? Is it becauſe Chriſts true Religion cannot be made evidently credible to Reaſon? No certainly. For, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which hath ſtood invincible in the heat of ſo many perſecutions, which hath converted whole Kingdoms and Nations, and drawn Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of ſouls to it, muſt neceſſarily appear moſt
<pb facs="tcp:102687:5"/> evidently Credible to all rational men. Is it becauſe a fals Religion cannot be Argued of Falſhood? No. It is as eaſy to convince an erroneous Sect of errour, as to prove true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be true. And Hence, I ſay, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible <hi>to conceive any Thing like Religion, that can neither be Proved evidently credible,</hi> or manifeſtly <hi>Argued</hi> of <hi>Falſhood.</hi> The Reaſon is, Becauſe the evident Credibility of true Religion (if one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be true in the VVorld) takes off from the fals Religion all <hi>Prudent credibility,</hi> and leaves it uttely deſtitute of Motives founding credibility. In a word, The <hi>euident credibility</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> makes <hi>Falſhood</hi> highly improbable. VVhence I inferr. If true Religion be made thus manifeſtly <hi>credible</hi> by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, Rational Proofs cannot fail to countenance that which He will have <hi>manifeſtly known.</hi> Contrarywiſe, ſuch proofs muſt of neceſſity be wanting to a fals Religion, which God will have to appear both <hi>evidently Incredible,</hi> and <hi>Improbable</hi> to <hi>prudent Reaſon.</hi> The Catholick therfore that hold's his Religion at leaſt <hi>evidently Credible</hi> before He believes, and <hi>certainly true</hi> by his Act of Faith, cannot but have Proofs at hand which Do not only clearly evidence the undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Credibility of it,</hi> but alſo Daſh and Diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb facs="tcp:102687:6"/> what ever can be ſaid in the Defence of a contrary Errour. On the other ſide, The Sectary muſt of neceſſity want ſuch grounded Proofs; And conſequently whether he Defend's his own, or impugn's the true Religion, All He ſaith will end at laſt in meer Cavils and wordy Fallacies. You have the Reaſon Hereof mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re largely laid forth Diſc. 1. C. 8. Becauſe God cannot permit in the Preſence (as it were) of his true Religion a fals Sect to appear ſo much as ſlightly Probable, which ever is and muſt be inferiour to Truth (or rather nothing) in the luſtre and evidence <hi>of Credibility.</hi> Which is to ſay in other Terms: An <hi>Erroneous Sect cannot he made at all Credible to Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. What then is the Reaſon, when the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick both ſuppoſeth and proves His Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be only true and Orthodox, that The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſtrifes go endleſly on between us and a few Proteſtants? Scarce any Book, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſolid and learned, is ſet forth by an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Catholick, but preſently a <hi>Thing</hi> called an Anſwer ſallies out againſt it. Exceptions are made by Sectaries, This, They ſay, Proves not, That Diſpleaſes &amp;c. In a word, if we believe them, All is Anſwered, when, God knowes, A
<pb facs="tcp:102687:6"/> prudent Reader ſee's the main Difficulties wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, And very often finds the very ſtate of the Queſtion gtoſly miſtaken. I'll ſay my thought freely, and humbly ſubmit all I ſay to the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Cenſure of every learned Catholick. As long as Sectaries (without a juſt and rational Reproof, <hi>it's all vve can Do</hi>) are permitted to continue ſtill the ſtrain of writing they conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow, which is to entertain the Reader with tedious Diſcourſes in general of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, when Proteſtancy is that which ſhould be Proved, with meer conjectures, bare negative Arguments And unproved Propoſitions, with their own forced and violent interpretations when an Authority urgeth, In a word, with their Gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and unworthy Cavils ſeaſoned with jeers when nothing els will Doe &amp;c. whilſt this is Don, The cloſe way of Arguing is laid aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, They may talk on to the worlds end, without fruit to Any but to the Printer only, that gains money by their Books. You will ask wat Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Againſt this proceding? An old Anſwer ſayes much: It is: When they go about, either to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve their own Novelties, or to impugn our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Doctrin, That we keep them from wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring to far from home, and Hold them cloſe
<pb facs="tcp:102687:7"/> to <hi>Proofs and Principles</hi> (theſe are the Shollers lawes, our Rules and Canons) Do this, and you'l ſoon ſe their long Diſcourſes Shrunk up to little, Their large volumes brought to a few ſheets of paper.

            <p n="5">5.

C. 8. Becauſe God, that lead's us in this preſent ſtate to the knowledge of His Revealed Truths, not by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſms
<pb facs="tcp:102687:7"/> or private Illuſtrations, but by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent inducements ſuitable to Reaſon, always ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes his true Religion ſo manifeſt by undubitable Signs, Marks, and Characters, that not only the learned, but the more ignorant may come (if prudence Guide him) to a clear Sight of it by certain Principles. We may, I think, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as ſecurely by light enough laid out to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in this weighty matter, as we do in other great Verities. For example: All acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Gods Divine Providence over the world, and Therfore have ſtrong Principles to prove the Truth. We Chriſtians ſay, That <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord And His Apoſtles taught moſt certain Heavenly Doctrin. Principles cannot be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prove this our Chriſtian Verity. VVe ſay, <hi>Iudaiſm</hi> and <hi>Mahometiſm</hi> are Fals Sects: The Aſſertion can be made Good by ſure and undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Proofs. The only Queſtion now under Diſpute is, whether we Catholicks or Sectaries profeſs and Teach the Ancient Orthodox Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin eſtabliſhed by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, And without all Controverſy certain Principles can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail in this particular, wherby the difference between us may be decided: Or if they Do fail, (which is not poſſible) every one may not only
<pb facs="tcp:102687:8"/> adhere without reproof to any Religion or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, as Fancy pleaſeth; But, moreover may moſt juſtly blame Almighty God (And this is hideouſly impious) who command's us on the one ſide to embrace true Religion, yet on the Other, Leaves us in ſuch Fearful darknes, That none after a diligent ſearch can find out by ſure <hi>Principles, vvhat</hi> or <hi>vvhere</hi> that Religion is which He will have us to believe, to make profeſſion of, to live and dye in. And this would be highly contrary to his infinit Goodnes. Thus much premiſed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I ſay firſt. The Sectary, whether He takes in hand to eſtabliſh his own Opinions, or to impugn any Doctrin of our Catholick Faith, ſhall never come to an Intellectual light that hath a likelyhood of a ſure Principle. The Reaſon is moſt evident in Catholick grounds (I ſay no more yet) <hi>Becauſe Truth cannot be contrary to Truth:</hi> If therfore Catholick Religion be true, what ever the Sectary ſayes againſt it, when he either Plead's for his own, or oppugn's our Doctrin, muſt of neceſsity be ſo remote from ſure Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, That his whole Talk, <hi>ultimatly Reſolved,</hi> will appear in its own likenes a meer cheat, and end in nothing but a fallacy; For it is not <hi>Poſsible to
<pb facs="tcp:102687:8"/> force Truth</hi> out of <hi>Falſhood,</hi> or to make that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable which is <hi>Eſſentially improbable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. I ſay 2. It cannot but be moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to every prudent diſintereſſed Iudgement, That Sectaries have nothing like ſound recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Principles to rely on, whether They oppugn our Catholick Doctrin, or Defend their own Opinions. To clear this Aſſertion from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, you ſhall ſe what we propoſe. Be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed only to take two or three ſheets of paper (much more is not needful) And permit a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Catholick <hi>briefly</hi> to ſet down in the firſt Pages of them, the Proofs he hath for his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Doctrin in one particular Controverſy now agitated (this ſhort way of Arguing will do the deed) Then let the Proteſtant write all he can ſay for his contrary <hi>Propoſition</hi> in the other Pages, And if you do not ſe a ſtrange <hi>unequal Parallel</hi> of Proofs, And no Proofs laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, call me what you will, I'll bear a juſt rebuke, yet fear not any. <hi>I ſay, pitch upon One Controverſy</hi> now in Diſpute. For Example that one long debated (we cannot now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon all) may be thought of. <hi>Viz. VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Recours had to the Saints in Heaven by the Prayers of the living, be erroneous or true Doctrin?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102687:9"/> Next permit the Queſtion to be truely ſtated, and then Hear what the Catholick ſayes for Himſelf. He tell's you firſt the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church and the Greek Church alſo, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Orthodox or Schiſmatical teach, as He believes. 2. He produceth Scriptures to prove his Doctrin. 3. He alleges Fathers both Greek and Latin quoted by every Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical writer on this ſubject. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> furniſheth you moſt plentifully <hi>lib. 1. de Sanct. Beati cap.</hi> 19. The wit of man cannot wreſt them to a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe contrary to our Catholick Poſition. 4. You will have His Reaſons, and that one moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding: Good men laudably pray for us he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re on earth: <hi>Ergo,</hi> much more the Saints in Heaven (becauſe in a better ſtate) can do that Charity. When the Catholick hath ended his Proofs grounded on theſe and the like undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Principles.</hi> Caſt your thoughts a little on the Sectaries Contrary proofs, And mark well his <hi>Principles.</hi> Hath He any Church reputed Orthodox either now, or ſix hundred years agon, That expreſly and poſitively defended his Opinion, and condemned our Doctrin? No, moſt evidently not any. Hath he ſo much as one ſyllable of Scripture, that plainly and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
<pb facs="tcp:102687:9"/> Denyes our Catholick poſition, and ſpeak's for his? Not a word is found in the whole Bible to that purpoſe, much againſt it. Hath he Fathers ſo numerous and clear for his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, as we produce for this one Truth, <hi>Saints can both hear and help us?</hi> Not one Father is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs againſt us, or <hi>plain</hi> for his contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Parallel therfore a Church and no Church, Scripture and no Scripture, Fathers expreſs for us, and not one againſt us: And judge you whether it be not evident to every diſintereſſed judgement, that Proteſtants want ſound Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to rely on in this Controverſy. And as you ſe a Defect of Principles here, ſo you will find it in all other Diſputes between us. Now if they ſay, They value not much of our <hi>Church Authority.</hi> I anſwer, They ſpeak without Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, For the ſole judgement of our Church (had we no more) will be thought in any juſt Tribunal a ſtronger proof for our Doctrin, then their meer ſlighting of it can be <hi>without</hi> a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood of proof. If They ſay again, They can either Deny or explicate the Fathers we produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, I Anſwer, They are ſtill out of Principles: <hi>For their Denial is weightles, unles They ground it upon a ſurer Principle,</hi> then that Authority is, which they
<pb facs="tcp:102687:10"/> Deny. Obſerve well. We have innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Fathers Greek and Latin expreſs for the Invocation of Saints. Say therfore, What will it Avail the Sectary barely to reject theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities (becauſe they are the words of men and not of God) Vnles He Give you the plain word of God, or the Authority of an Orthodox Church (in place of them) <hi>wheron his Denial hath ſure footing?</hi> If this be not don, He comes to nothing like a Principle, conſequently the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Authority (moſt agreable to the Churches Doctrin) is a clear Demonſtration againſt him. If He Pretend to allege Fathers contrary to ours: I Anſwer, He hath not one <hi>expreſs or plainly contrary.</hi> However, falſly ſuppoſe, He had one or two, The conteſt would then be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one that ſtands, as it were, alone oppoſit to the Churches Doctrin, or many Fathers that ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de with the Church deſerve more credit? Here I am ſure He will ſtand without footing on any certain Principle. If He tell you Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Primitive Church prayed not to Saints: They are his own empty words. We prove the contrary, by the expreſs Teſtimonies of moſt ancient Fathers, and the Tradition of our Church, whilſt He remains ſpeechles and without a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb facs="tcp:102687:10"/> to ground his Aſſertion on. If He Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject fourthly. His Reaſons, chiefly two <hi>viz. Prayers to Saints leſsens our Honor to Christ.</hi> And, <hi>we cannot ſay how our prayers</hi> come to the Saints Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp;c. I Anſwer. Here is nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, for an Objection (as ſoon ſolved as ſeen) is far off from the nature of a <hi>ſound Principle.</hi> We ſay therfore, if to pray for one an other Here on Earth leſſens not <hi>Chriſts</hi> Honor, there is no danger of leſſening it by our recours had to the Saints in Heaven, now in a moſt Glorious and happy Condition. And thus, no leſs a Doctor then <hi>S. Hierom, Adverſus vigilantium,</hi> Paris print 1609. pag. 590. Solves the Difficulty at thoſe words. <hi>Dicis in libello tuo</hi> &amp;c. Thou, <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> ſaith in thy Book, that whilſt we live we may pray for one another, but after Death no Prayer is heard for Any. Here is the Objection. Mark <hi>S.

(to omit innumerable others) Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the Doctrin, but that worthy Biſhop al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>S. Greg Nyſſen</hi> in his Oration of <hi>S.

As you are a ſouldier fight for us and defend us, And as a Martyr ſpeak freely for your fellovv ſervants here.</hi> A few lines after. <hi>And if more Prayer be needful, aſſemble together the vvhole Quire
<pb facs="tcp:102687:11"/> of your Brethren Martyrs, and joyntly intercede for us. Put S. Peter in mind, move S. Paul, and the beloved Diſciple of our Lord S. Iohn, that they be ſolicitous for the Churches, vvhere once they vvore Chains, paſſed dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and finally Dyed.</hi> Say now, what leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is here of <hi>Christs</hi> Honor by the prayer of this Ancient Saint and moſt learned Prelate? Or what anſwer can be returned to theſe three Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities? The other Difficulty is as forceles: For if Scctaries can explicate how the bleſſed Soul of our Saviour in Heaven hear's our Prayers, which I hope they will not Deny (I ſpeak of his Sanctified created Soul) all Difficulty ceaſeth in the preſent Controverſy: <hi>How They hear</hi> is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion (ſe <hi>Bell. cap. 20. n. Argumentum tertium</hi>) But <hi>That they Hear,</hi> is certain Doctrin.</p>
            <p>7. Now if Sectaries tell us They can ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate Theſe Fathers as to make their words <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant</hi> to our Purpoſe: I would firſt learn, what can be ſaid to <hi>S. Hierom, S. Austin,</hi> and <hi>S. Gregory</hi> now cited; But this is not all, for I am to aſſure them further, <hi>That their explications, when contrary to the Doctrin of a whole Church, as alſo to the obvious ſenſe of either Scripture or Fathers quoted by us, are ſo far off from being Principles, that they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit not the name of mean probabilities;</hi> which Truth
<pb facs="tcp:102687:12"/> is more amply Declared <hi>Diſcours 4. c. 4. n.</hi> 8. 9. Where I prove that no Interpretation of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries can be Allowed of, unles it rely on an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick Ground much ſurer then His Gloſs is that interpret's, which therfore muſt be plain Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, The undoubted conſent of Fathers, Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Tradition, or ſuch like convincing Principles. Hence I ſaid, when the Catholick Interprets a dubious or Difficil Paſſage, He never makes his <hi>Gloſs to be the ultimate Proof of his Doctrin,</hi> But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that proved by ſtronger Principles <hi>diſtinct from His Interpretation.</hi> All is contrary with the Sectary, <hi>who makes His Gloſs to do all, to be the last and ſureſt ground of his Opinion, without the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of any better Proof then his own word is.</hi> And thus much is evident in other Controverſies now Debated between us, as you will ſee Hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="8">8. From this want of clear Principles, all the too manifeſt and moſt Diſcernable Faint pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of our Adverſaries in matters now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, ſhewes it ſelf ſo openly, that one with half an Eye may Diſcover it. It is From want of Principles, That they now begin to be weary of Proteſtancy, and hold that a Faith Common to all Sectaries is ſufficient to Saluation: if this
<pb facs="tcp:102687:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> may Paſs, They need not herafter to ſtand more for Proteſtancy then Arianiſm, or for any other condemned Hereſy. For the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Principles (were there Any) would make both <hi>Sects equally Credible.</hi> Hence it alſo is, That you have them ever Cavilling at our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (and 'Tis the eaſieſt thing in the world to Find fault, Yea, and to cavil at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of Holy Scripture it ſelf, you ſe Arians do ſo) but ſtill you find them wanting in that which concern's them moſt, which is to bring their <hi>Novelties</hi> to the grounds of either <hi>Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> or any Ancient <hi>Church Doctrin:</hi> Herin they are as mute, as Fiſhes, and ſay not a word. It is from want of Principles, That, when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate a Council or Father alleged againſt them, They are tediouſly long about little, that is in relating the circumſtances to be as They would have Them, but whether they hit right is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a matter of Diſpute, and nothing like a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Principle.

From want of Principles it is That they ever place againſt our clear Authorities no more but meer uncertain Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, And pick out of our Writers all they can pilfer for Their Advantage, wheras, if they had a good cauſe in hand and ſound Principles to rely on, They ſhould beat down the Doctrin of long ſtanding Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

From hence it alſo is, That when a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin pleaſeth them, Tradition is approved of; But if it be contrary to their Fancy, then Tradition is of no account or value. For example. Prayer for the Dead is as well a univerſal Tradition of both the Greek and Latin Church, as to hold that Canon of the
<pb facs="tcp:102687:13"/> Sectaries Bible to be the Word of God, yet the one is admitted of, And the other ſet light by; And upon what Principle (Diſtinct from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Conjectures) Do They take and leave as they liſt? Finally, it is for want of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, That in <hi>lieu</hi> of ſolid Arguments in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Controverſy now handled you have words in ſtead of <hi>Subſtance,</hi> margents painted with <hi>Greek and Latin,</hi> now a ſtory told of a Pope or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, now a jeer, now a jeſt in handſom lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage &amp;c. And thus they hold on in their Merriments, Thoughtles, as it ſeems, of an accounting Day to come before a ſever Iudge, and a long Eternity that follows.

When again I find it of a vaſt

When I ſee it glorious Evidenced by Miracles, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful in the Converſions of Infidels, eminent in Sanctity, And moſt profound learning. When I conſider How it hath ſtood invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the heat of all perſecutions, and call to mind the Hereſies vainquiſhed by it Age after Age, To ſay no more now of other ſignal Marks wherwith it is made illuſtrious and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to all.

            <p n="10">10. Now on the other ſide, when I caſt my Thoughts on a Few late riſen Company of Divided Sectaries, utterly Deſtitute of all

Thirdly: No ſmall part of this <hi>Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> ſeem's to be too trivial, while later Catholik writers are introduced ſpeaking, as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poole</hi> thinks, diſadvantagiouſly, and againſt our Faith. Now <hi>Sixtus Senenſis</hi> ſayes <hi>this,</hi> now <hi>Bellarmin that,</hi> now <hi>Stapleton</hi> a third thing, &amp;c. And are theſe, think ye, doughty Doings for ſuch an Antagoniſt, that offers to ſtrike at the <hi>very root</hi> of the Roman Church? Alas, what he cites thus, were all he cites true, is a <hi>Nullity</hi> indeed, and a meer nothing; for <hi>Church Doctrin</hi> depends on no mans private opinion: But, when we make an inſpection into theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors (as I have done on ſeveral occaſions, and find them quoted by halfs, weighed out of their circumſtances, mangled, and traduced to a ſiniſter ſenſe) we muſt ſpeak truth, That cheats will go on their way, and rather play at ſmall game, then ſit out, or ſeem to do nothing.</p>
            <p>Had Proteſtants any thing like a good cauſe in hand, or Truth on their ſide, they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly plead more manfully for it, and never like poor people in harveſt, go thus a gleaning up and down our Authors (known for profeſſed Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102687:16"/> who little, God knows, intended to favour Sectaries by ſuch ſegments, as they are pleaſed to pick up, much leſs to furniſh Proteſtants with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour againſt Catholik Doctrin. But what will ye? Sectaries can do no better. Yet I muſt tell you what they ought to do, whilſt they embrace a Novelty, and caſt of the old Religion. They ſhould make the ancient Canons to roar againſt our Doctrin, they ſhould confound and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm us with undeniable proofs, drawn from plain Scripture, ancient Councils, univerſal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the unanimous conſent of Fathers: Of theſe we hear no great noiſe. Next (and this moſt concerns them) They ſhould alſo <hi>poſitively</hi> prove, and eſtabliſh every Article of Proteſtant Religion, as <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> by ſuch plain, open, and illuſtrious Authorities, then a <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> a <hi>Stapleton,</hi> a <hi>Maldonate</hi> and others might well follow the rear: But to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour with a few broken fragments, I'll eſpyed in theſe Modern Authors (and worſe applyed) without attending to their whole drift, <hi>antecedent</hi> and <hi>conſequent,</hi> and think to defeat an Ancient Church with ſuch trivial Doings, is ſo ſlight a way of ſchirmiſhing, that it deſerves no counterblow, but pitty and compaſsion. That incomparable Author of the <hi>Proteſtants Apology,</hi> learn's them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102687:17"/> way of arguing, whilſt he doth not only ſhew the endles claſhing of Sectaries amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but moreover ſolidly proves our Catholik Doctrin <hi>poſitively,</hi> and this by the moſt ſatisfactory and undeniable Principles, that a lover of Truth can wiſh for.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe new men ſhould defend their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, and it is no fault of ours that they trifle it out, and do no better. We charge enough upon them, and could they well acquit themſelves, they would certainly go more cloſely to work, and anſwer directly. We ſay, and will prove it, That, that Doctrin which they believe as <hi>Protestants,</hi> contrary to the Roman Catholik Faith, is evidently no part of any Chriſtian belief, but a meer Opinion grounded on fancy only. We ſay, and will prove it, that this new Religion of Proteſtancy hath all the marks and characters of hereſy following it, which can be thought on: not one is wanting; for, if <hi>Arius</hi> of old, who quited the ancient Roman Church, and banded againſt it, was, upon that account, both <hi>ſchiſmatick</hi> and <hi>heretick,</hi> our Sectaries are <hi>in eâdem nave,</hi> and have done ſo, their cauſe and caſe, in other matters, is the very ſame. 2. As <hi>Arius</hi> ſtood all alone at his firſt riſe, oppoſite to the reſt of Chriſtians, and was oppoſed by all, ſo
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102687:17"/> were they alſo both oppoſite, and oppoſed by all. 3. As he began without commiſſion to broach his Novelties againſt the ancient Faith, ſo are they as wholy unco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsioned to preach Theirs: And here we give them matter enough to work on, and conjure them to produce their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. 4. As <hi>Arius,</hi> ſupported by ſecular power, vented what ever he pleaſed without curb, or any ſuperiour law to check him, and therfore fell into deſperate Extravagancies; ſo are our new men lawles alſo, and ſubmit to none but their own fancy and ſelf-judgement. Finally, as <hi>Arius,</hi> without warrant of the Church, interpreted Scripture as his own weak reaſon taught him, juſt ſo do our Sectaries: here only is the difference, That he had a plauſible ſound of <hi>Scripture-words</hi> for his hereſy; Proteſtants have neither ſound, nor ſyllable, nor ſenſe through the whole Bible for one article of Proteſtancy, as <hi>Protestancy.</hi> This I ſhall make good hereafter.</p>
            <p>Here is charge enough drawn up againſt them; but by what ſatisfactory known and <hi>received Principles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which force reaſon to acquieſce (and we make a ſearch after theſe) they can acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or rationally anſwer, is a heavy difficulty. I'll tell you in a word (and remember it) they ſhall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102687:18"/> never anſwer by any thing that hath the look of a rational <hi>proof,</hi> or a <hi>received Principle.</hi> No: Their own ſole proofles word, wheron the whole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin of Proteſtancy is built, upholds what ever they teach: They have no more. They ſay, 'tis true, they left the ancient Roman Church, becauſe it left it ſelf, but yet ſtick cloſe to the Primitive Doctrin. Obſerve it: They are here both Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers of us, and Iudges in their own cauſe. Their proofles word doth all, without reducing it to any known or certain owned Principle. Not one Council, not one Canon, no ancient Tradition, no conſent of Fathers can they produce, wherby par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men are lycenſed to riſe up againſt an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Mother Church, and condemn it of falſe Doctrin. They will tell you, that they ſtood all alone when <hi>Luther</hi> roſe up, yet taught, forſooth, the true Goſpel of <hi>Ieſus Christ:</hi> and we muſt believe them. Here is the laſt <hi>Propoſitio quieſcens. They ſay ſo:</hi> To what we charge againſt their uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned Authority to preach as they did, you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve the like uncommiſsioned anſwer: The Lord ſent them abroad, and the Truth they taught ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures them. But of theſe weak wordy replyes I have ſaid to much in this ſhort Digreſsion.</p>
            <p>Let us now retourn to <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poole:</hi> And I muſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102687:18"/> ſay, all he hath vented in his <hi>Nullity</hi> or <hi>Appendix</hi> againſt us, comes to no more, but to a moſt weak aſſault of a feeble Adverſary; for this man, who endeavorus to prove that both Church and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and what elſe you can mention, are fallible, can never aſſume to himſelf, or tye to any Community he joyns with the Spirit of Infallibility: For, if the infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt down; down, ſay I, alſo with the infallibility of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church, of the Grecian Church, and of all other ſocieties of Chriſtians. With ſome of theſe <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poole</hi> is liſted, and therfore I cannot but hold him, and his Adherents, men of no more, then of a fallible Religion. Hence I argue: Suppoſe, which is utterly falſe, that the Church, or all Churches, all Councils, all Fathers are fallible, and that Chriſtian Religion (as it is taught by theſe) is likewiſe falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Admit alſo, that I were to embrace one of theſe many fallible Religions, (which I ſhall never do) will not prudence dictate, if I have no other certainty then theſe meer uncertainties to rely on, that it is better to hold where I am, and ſtick to my ancient Religion, glorious with innumerable Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, Doctors, Confeſſors, &amp;c. then to give up my Faith to <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Pooles</hi> poſt-nate fallible Religion, and falſe diſcours? How therfore can this man ſo much
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102687:19"/> as once endeavour, to draw me, or any, of my more ancient and univerſal Religion (though ſuppoſed fallible) to another new one, which lyes ſick of the ſame diſeaſe, totters, and reel's as much as mine (if not more) and in a word is fallible? Of two evils the leſſe is to be choſen. It is an evil without doubt, to have no Religion certain; yet, if I were to chooſe one of two uncertain Religions, and could by no certain <hi>Teacher</hi> learn which of them is <hi>worſe</hi> (being both naught) I would either pitch where I liſt, and as my fancy lead's me; or rather chooſe none at all, knowing wel, that a ruin of all Faith, followes the renouncing of certainty in Religion. But of this more hereafter. In the interim,</p>
            <p>I would know of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poole,</hi> whether this ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge and unheard of Propoſition: <hi>Chriſtian Religion, as it is taught and delivered by all Paſtors, Doctors,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is fallible,</hi> be <hi>ſubjectively</hi> in him that ſpeak's it, an <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Aſſertion,</hi> or <hi>fallible?</hi> If the firſt, we have an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Pope (I mean <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poole</hi>) who without either <hi>Scripture, Church,</hi> or <hi>Council,</hi> can ſpeak infallibly in matters of Faith. If that formal Propoſition be fallible, it fall's of it ſelf, without further proof, to nothing, and renders this ſenſe: I. M. P. ſay by a fallible Aſſertion, that Chriſtian Religion is fallible; which feeble Aſſertion (and the weaker
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102687:19"/> it is, the worſe it is for him) cannot at all ſtartle me, or any, who upon the Authority of thouſands more learned than he (to ſay no more) hold one Religion, and but one only, certain and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. Perhaps he will ſay, that though his Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition be fallible, yet it is highly probable againſt the pretended Infallibility of the Roman Church, no other ſociety of Chriſtians laying claim to infallibility. Mark by the way what this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary drives at. It is to tell the world a <hi>word of comfort,</hi> viz. That <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> hath now no certain and infallible Religion taught or learned in the whole Chriſtian world; And to make this moſt fallible and falſe Propoſition good, he back's it by another of his own, as falſe and fallible, viz. <hi>It is at leaſt highly probable, that the Church of Rome is fallible.</hi> Pray you on what leggs doth this high <hi>ſuppoſed probability</hi> ſtand? I'll tell you, it ſtands only on <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Pooles</hi> weak thoughts, and unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted word, more you have not. For, never did any ancient Council, or univerſal Tradition, or the unanimous conſent of Fathers hold it a thing <hi>highly probable,</hi> that either Chriſtian Religion, or the Catholik Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is fallible. Doth the Scripture favour any where this wild Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? No, not one ſyllable is found to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102687:20"/> we have texts enough to the contrary; ſome I ſhall quote on a fitter occaſion.</p>
            <p>You will ask what then is it, that <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Pooles</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves againſt us in the fourth Chapter of his <hi>Nullity?</hi> I anſwer, juſt nothing. His whole ſtrain is thus: After much tampering with thoſe convincing places of holy Scripture, uſually alledged for the Churches Infallibility, and ſpoiling all with his fallible fancies, he goes negatively to work, and tell's us: Such and ſuch texts (turned out of their genuine ſenſe by his gloſſes) come not home, nor prove any Church infallible; and it is no wonder, for, as perverted by him, they are none of Gods Scripture, but his own ſcribled whimſies. Take here one inſtance for many, that text of <hi>S. Paul, 1. Tim.</hi> 3. 15. where the Church is ſtiled <hi>the pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> ſeem's plain enough, open, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificant for the Catholik ſenſe. Now comes <hi>Mr. Poole</hi> with his gloſſes, <hi>page</hi> 86. and ſaith perhaps, here may be an Ellipſis, of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may be writ for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and if ſo, <hi>Timothy</hi> was the pillar, not the Church. Again, The Church here ſpoken of, may be that wherin <hi>Timothy</hi> was placed, not the Roman. 3. The term of pillar, notes the ſolidity, not the infallibility of the Church. 4. It may no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te the Churches Duty, not her practiſe with a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102687:20"/> 
               <hi>long, &amp;c.</hi> Obſerve wel. Vpon theſe wretched fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ſuppoſitions <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poole</hi> ſeem's to conclude, that thoſe words are unconcluding for the Infallibility of any Chriſtian ſociety. Put I ask by what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority muſt I ſuppoſe his Ellipſis, or that the Church ſpoken of was <hi>Timothy's</hi> Church, not the Vniverſal? That the term <hi>pillar</hi> notes not the Infallibility, &amp;c? Doth God ſpeak thus in Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, or rather doth not <hi>Mr. Poole</hi> vent theſe wild Fancies without Scripture or any unqueſtioned Authority? This later is moſt evident; And can he think by ſuch farfetcht gloſſes, either to rob the Apoſtle of his plain obvious ſenſe, or to make me believe that his gueſſes hit right on Gods true meaning, delivered in this text?</p>
            <p>If he reply, the meaning may be as he gueſſes. I anſwer, and it may not be as he gueſſes, Who is here to judge between us? Who can tell me, that <hi>Mr. Pools May be</hi> is a prop ſure enough to build my faith upon? He is therfore to ſhow poſitively by a <hi>Propoſitio quieſcens;</hi> that is, by ſome cogent proof and undoubted Authority, that <hi>S. Pauls</hi> words muſt be underſtood as he gloſſes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently is obliged to make good ſome one of theſe deſperate Propoſitions. <hi>Christ Ieſus hath now no infallible Religion taught or learned in the Chriſtian
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102687:21"/> world. All Chriſtian Societies are fallible. That holy and univerſal Church, mentioned in the Creed, is fallible, &amp;c.</hi> But to wave ſuch proofs, to lay hold on a Text in Scripture, and torture it as he pleaſeth, and after the miſuſage to tell us, the Text proves nothing; is only to ſport with Gods Word, and ſay, that Scripture made <hi>no Scripture</hi> by whole heaps of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible gloſſes, is proofles. The foundation is good, but the ſuperſtructure is naught. Give me the ſtrongeſt place in Scripture for any Article of Chriſtian faith, I can by pidling at the Text with unevidenced gloſſes, both ſo pervert and poyſon the words, that at laſt they ſpeak haereſy. Yet on ſuch unproved conjectures Proteſtant Religion ſtands, and can never have better footing, while Gods unwritten Word is rejected, and no infallible <hi>Teacher</hi> is allowed of, that learn's us Truth.</p>
            <p>One word more, and I end. Had thoſe two Gallants, <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> when they took upon them to reform the darkned world of Popery, thus allarm'd their Hearers. My Maſters: We Preach indeed a new Goſpel upon the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures we are able; but you muſt know, that all we ſay is fallible: How ſick would ſuch a ſaying have made the ſtrongeſt ſtomack amongſt them? For, if fallible, if uncertain Doctrin, it was none
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102687:21"/> of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> Doctrin, and therfore ſtood in need of a more pure refining. And how know our Proteſtants, but that yet a new ſort of People may ſtart-up, and make it their task to reform all the fallible Reformers, that have troubled the world ſince <hi>Luthers</hi> dayes? Had I no other juſt exception againſt our Proteſtants but thus much only; That they yet know not where about They are in their reformation, and becauſe fallible, can never know, whether for example the thing they have in hand; be yet a meer <hi>Embrio</hi> of Religion, or of a more perfect ſhape, a new layd egg, or a hatcht chicken; whether they themſelves are yet only Novices, Proficients, or Maſters in the trade of Reformation; I ſay, were there no more, This alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne would fright me from ever being Proteſtant.</p>
            <p>Believe it, the Profeſſors of an uncertain and endles reformable Religion ſhall never come to ſettlement, till they renounce the cheat and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as the Apoſtle teaches, <hi>ad Gal. 1. 8. Licet nos,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Altough we, or Angel from heaven preach otherwiſe to you then we have preached to you, let him be accurſed;</hi> which is fully to ſay: <hi>Believe him not.</hi> And here by the way obſerve, how deſtructive theſe words are of an uncertain and fallible teaching, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion; for admit (which <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poole</hi> grants)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102687:22"/> that all Chriſtian Communities, all Councils, all Fathers, all Tradition, &amp;c. deliver only Fallible Doctrin, (that is, Doctrin lyable to errour) I only may not, but am obliged to disbelieve this Truth of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and believe him, or, an Angel ſent from heaven, if either of them preached contrary to this fallible Learning. Why? Doctrin that is fallible may be falſe; but the preaching of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſent from heaven cannot be falſe, and therfore is more certain then Chriſtian Doctrin, that may be falſe. But I am obliged to quit the leſſe certain Doctrin, for the moſt certain preaching of an Angel; <hi>ergo</hi> I muſt relinquiſh Chriſtianity, if an Angel preach againſt it. The reaſon is. The leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer light yeilds to the greater, probability ſubmits to certainty, and my fallible (though highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) Aſſent cannot but yeild to the infallible Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of an Angel, if he ſpeak contrary to it.</p>
            <p>Theſe few conſiderations premiſed, we muſt inſiſt more largely on this ſubject, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that there are living and infallible Teachers of Religion in ſome one Society of Chriſtians or other; which is directly oppoſite to <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poole,</hi> who holds, That no men are ſo highly priviledged by Almighty God, as to have <hi>ſubjective infallibility,</hi> or, to teach infallibly; though, perhaps, they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102687:22"/> truth (as it were by chance) but not <hi>infallibly as Teachers.</hi> I ſay, <hi>as Teachers,</hi> for by what I can learn by <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poole</hi> and other Proteſtants, They think all done when they tell us, That the <hi>objective Doctrin</hi> delivered in Scripture is infallible, (which yet they cannot know without an infallible Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and therfore in ſaying this, they ſpeak only fallibly:) but admit they know ſo much, they are never the better for it, unles they joyntly own ſome Oracle, ſome certain Maſter, who by Divine aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance interpret's Scripture without errour, and as exactly convey's into our harts Gods written re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Verities, when any doubt ariſeth, as if the Apoſtles taught us. Theſe Teachers are they (can we find them out) that circumſcribe our ranging Fancies, and put a limit to our ſwerving Thoughts, while we often read, and ſeldom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe great ſecrets which God hath layd up in the book of Sctipture, without them (as we ſee by too ſad experience) our weak rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſtrong Fancies pervert all, and produce monſters of haereſies out of Scripture it ſelf, wherof more hereafter.</p>

If they diſown ſuch infallible Believers, they muſt joyntly deny all infallible Faith, and conſequently ſay, That though God hath revealed in Scripture innumerable Verities, yes, and for this end, to

And that not ſo much as one, amongſt them <hi>all,</hi> is ſo Highly priviledged, as to inſtruct with certainty?

The directing thread, that ſafely drawes us out of theſe Labirinths, is <hi>Sure, Firm,</hi> and <hi>infallible Faith;</hi> we ask to learn this of our new Doctors, and not one can certainly ſay, <hi>Such is the way: This infallibly is the Faith</hi> that winds us out of errour, and moſt aſſuredly lead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s to Heaven: or, if any ſay ſo much, he ſpeaks only Fallibly.</p>

They have Paſtors that talk, but Teach nothing certainly: They have <hi>Infallible Verities</hi> lock'd up in Scripture, but none can open that Book, or convey them with Aſſurance into mens harts: They hear God ſpeak, but none of them certainly knows what he ſayes: They have <hi>Chriſts</hi> Promiſes of a <hi>Spirit of Truth' abyding</hi> with ſome Chriſtian Teachers (find them where they can) for ever, <hi>to the end of the world;</hi> but now, They muſt ſay, becauſe all Paſtors <hi>are fallible,</hi> That <hi>Chriſt</hi> keep's not his word, if all may deceive, and Teach both fallible and falſe Doctrin. Finally, they muſt own ſuch Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as <hi>S.

               <p n="1">1. THe proof of my Aſſertion is more fully decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Chap. 4. n.</hi> 6. and relyes on this Principle <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Doctrin taught only fallibly, under that notion of fallibly taught Doctrin, is not the Doctrin of Chriſt. We are of God,</hi> ſaith Scripture, <hi>Iohn Epiſt. 1. cap. 4. v. 6. He that knowes God, hear's us; he that is not of God, heareth us not. Hereby we know the Spirit of Truth, and the Spirit of errour.</hi> Which is to ſay in other Terms. He that hear's an infallible Teacher, hath the Spirit of Truth; and he that hear's not an infallible Teacher, wants this Spirit of Truth. Again, <hi>Epiſt. 2. v. 9. Every one that recedes, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and remains not in the Doctrin of Chriſt, hath not God, &amp;c.</hi> But every one, that Hears only a fallible Teacher, eaſily recedes, and <hi>remains</hi> not in the Doctrin of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath not God, nor the Spirit of Truth in him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon theſe grounds I Argue further. <hi>Chriſt</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, infallible in it ſelf, is either now taught <hi>infallibly</hi> by ſome Paſtors lawfully ſent, or fallibly. If the firſt; we muſt own infallible Teachers of this infallible Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin. If the ſecond, That is, if <hi>Chriſts</hi> infallible Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin be taught only Fallibly, <hi>ex parte Docentis,</hi> it followes evidently, firſt, That though God ſpeaks infallibly, yet no man hath certainty of what he ſaith. It followes ſecondly, That ſuch a fallible Teaching of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102687:25"/> may be cavilled at, and diſputed againſt. For,<note place="margin">Doctrin taught Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly may be cavilled at, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed againſt.</note> all Doctrin taught <hi>fallibly,</hi> and which by force of its <hi>Propoſal,</hi> or merit of the Doctrin, may deceive and be falſe, is lyable to cavil, and diſpute; Therfore this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin may be alſo cavilled at, and diſputed againſt. It followes thirdly, That really <hi>Chriſts</hi> Doctrin (perchance perverted by a fallible and falſe Delivery) may not be Taught at all. The reaſon is: No other Doctrin is, or can be taught, but what is <hi>fallible, and may be falſe:</hi> but <hi>Chriſts</hi> Doctrin is nor fallible, nor can be falſe; Therfore that Doctrin which is only Taught fallibly (as it is ſo delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) <hi>is none of Christs infallible Doctrin.</hi> Conſequently, if any man would now utterly abjure all the taught Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Chriſtian world, he might do it without being an Haeretick. I prove it: He who only abjures and Denies Fallible Doctrin which may be falſe, neither abjures nor denies <hi>Chriſts</hi> Doctrin nor any Chriſtian Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which cannot be falſe: But all Chriſtian Doctrin, that can be Taught (Sectaries ſay) is Fallible and may be Falſe; Therfore he who Denies ſuch a fallible taught <hi>Doctrin,</hi> denies not <hi>Chriſts</hi> Doctrin, and cannot be upon that account an Haeretick. You will ſay: He who Denies all Chriſtian taught <hi>Doctrin,</hi> certainly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſome of thoſe <hi>Objective Verities</hi> which are revealed in Gods Word, and therfore is an Haeretick. Very true, if he be ſure, That his Teacher delivers thoſe Verities <hi>infallibly:</hi> But our Proteſtants ſay, Becauſe all Teachers<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Infallible Doctrin taught only fallibly, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of</hi> Chriſts <hi>infallible Verities.</hi>
                  </note> are fallible, none can have that Aſſurance from them, or any; Therfore their Doctrin, <hi>as it is taught</hi> fallibly, may be cavilled at, yes, and denied alſo without the guilt of Haereſy. The reaſon is. Whoever, only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the fallible Teaching of infallible Doctrin (yet not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102687:26"/> known for ſuch) Denies not the <hi>Objective infallible</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin in it ſelf, but the <hi>Formal fallible Delivery of it;</hi> and this, he may boldly ſay, is none of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Doctrin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſubſtance of what I would here expreſſe, may<note place="margin">
                     <hi>No aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce can be had from men that Teach</hi> Chriſts <hi>Doctrin fallibly.</hi>
                  </note> perhaps more plainly be reduced to <hi>Form</hi> thus: A ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of men, who can do no more but only Teach fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Doctrin, <hi>which may be falſe,</hi> can aſſure none, that they Teach <hi>Chriſts infallible Doctrin, which cannot be falſe:</hi> But all ſocieties of Chriſtians can do no more but Teach fallible Doctrin which may be falſe, (for all Churches, all Councils, all Fathers, all Papiſts, all Proteſtants, and <hi>Mr. Poole</hi> with them, are (as they ſay) Fallible in their Feaching;) Therfore not one amongſt them can aſſure any, that he Teaches or Delivers the infallible Doctrin of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> I ſay, <hi>That he Teaches;</hi> for, if we meet with a Simplician That tel's us, He builds his Faith and Religion, not upon any Preachers talk, but on the <hi>Objective Verities</hi> revealed in Scripture. I anſwer: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les<note place="margin">Objective revealed Verities no ſufficient ground of infallible Faith.</note> he firſt learn of ſome Infallible Oracle, what Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re exactly ſpeak's in a hundred controverted places, he ſhall never by his own poreing on a Bible either arrive to the depth of God true meaning, or derive infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Faith from thoſe <hi>Objective revealed Verities.</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſuppoſeth, That all Truth couched in Scripture, is as eaſily underſtood, with the unclaſping of a Bible, as the ſun is ſeen at noon-day. If ſo, Miniſters here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after may (for the moſt of men) ſhut their books, ſtop their mouths, and preach no more.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some yet perhaps will ſay: One may preach the infallible Doctrin of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> though himſelf be falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Delivery of it, which feem's manifeſt; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Catechiſt, or Preacher, though he delivers the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102687:26"/> Doctrin of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet delivers it not <hi>infallibly;</hi> why therfore may not Miniſters in England teach, as thoſe do, infallible Doctrin, though, <hi>ex parte ſubjecti docentis,</hi> they Teach it fallibly? I anſwer firſt: Miniſters in England have no Infallible Church to recurre to, in caſe They erre; for their whole Community is fallible. The Catholick Preacher hath a ſure Oracle to rely on; an Infallible Church, that unbeguil's him if he ſwerve from Truth, which is a mighty Advantage and a great<note place="margin">The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church.</note> Diſparity in the preſent queſtion. Now if you ſay Sectaries may as well rely on infallible Scripture for their Direction, as we do on an Infallible Church; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the <hi>Suppoſition,</hi> and ſhall ſhew hereafter, That not ſo much as one Article of Proteſtancy can be proved by Scripture. Again: No man call's into doubt the <hi>Objective Verities</hi> contained in Scripture, known as ſuch: But here is the difficulty, whether the new invented Interpretations made on Scripture by Sectaries be true or falſe; and if falſe, They have no Infallible Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to amend the Errour as the Catholick Teacher hath.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I anſwer ſecondly: <hi>S. Paul,</hi> methinks, layes foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation enough to ſolve the Objection, <hi>Rom. 10. 15. How ſhall They preach unles they he ſent?</hi> Why therfore may we not aſſert. That every Catechiſt, every Preacher that hath a lawful Miſſion, and is ſent by the Infallible Church to preach <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſacred Doctrin, if he preach that Doctrin which <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Church approves of, is then, under that Notion of a <hi>Member conjoyned</hi> with an Infallible Church, Infallible in his Teaching? Though all vulgar taught Doctrin is not ſuch. Now Miniſters, who are unſent men, and therfore divorced
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102687:27"/> from this infallible <hi>Moral Body,</hi> cannot but talk, as they do, Fallibly.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I would not have any to miſtake my meaning. Know therfore firſt: I do not ſay, That this or that Paſtor, purely conſidered as a Paſtor, is infallible in all he Teaches. Nor ſecondly, That either Councils aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, or particular Biſhops, are by any intrinſick <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent quality</hi> elevated to a ſtate of Inſallibility. But thirdly, I affirm: That God, who, according to <hi>Chriſts</hi> promiſe, will ever guide his Church in Truth, cannot permit All the Paſtors and Teachers in it to ſwerve from Carholick Doctrin: For, if ſo, The whole Catholick Church might erre, which is contrary to<note place="margin">Paſtors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lawfully ſent teach Infallible Doctrin infallibly.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſts</hi> promiſe. Hence I ſay, fourthly: Every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop or Paſtor, though not <hi>Perſonally</hi> infallible, yet when he is ſent to preach <hi>Chriſts</hi> Doctrin, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies with his Duty, That is, when he Teaches No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what he hath commiſſion to teach in the Name of God and his Church; ſuch a man. I ſay, conſidered as a <hi>nember conjoyned with an Infallible Church</hi> in the Delivery of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Verities, may be ſayd to teach <hi>infallibly;</hi> For upon this ſuppoſition, he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak Truth as it were by chance (An Haeretick may do ſo;) But more, as he ſpeak's in the name of God and his Church, He teaches as the Church teacheth, that is, <hi>infallibly.</hi> The Reaſon is Manifeſt in Catholick Principles; Becauſe the Holy Ghoſt ever Aſſiſts ſome Paſtors in the Catholick Church to teach true <hi>Chriſtian Doctrin,</hi> and 'tis as certain that Thoſe he Aſſiſts teach it infallibly; Therfore a Paſtor, Prelate or Biſhop that Delivers <hi>Chriſts</hi> Doctrin, as is now declared, teaches Infallibly. You will ſay, This Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102687:27"/> or that Biſhop may, trough malice, ignorance, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Objections anſwered. </seg>
                  </label> or both, ſwerve from Truth. I grant it; but then he teaches not as one of Gods Miniſters, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies with <hi>his Miſsion.</hi> You will ſay again. Thus much at leaſt followes out of this Principle, That a Biſhop when he Teaches as <hi>lawfully ſent,</hi> is at that inſtant as infallible as the Pope when he Defines in Council; or, to ſpeak in <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Pooles</hi> homely language, hath a Pope in his belly. I anſwer. Every faithful Biſhop may have as Infallible Faith, as the Pope: what wonder is it therfore if, when he Teaches as both Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe and the Church teach, he be then ſayd to Teach <hi>infallibly?</hi> Yet there is a great Diſparity between the Pope and particular Paſtors, Biſhops, &amp;c. For no particular Biſhop can make any new <hi>Declarations</hi> of Faith <hi>obligeing</hi> all Chriſtians to believe; The Pope with a Council can do ſo. No particular Biſhop, <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely</hi> conſidered as ſuch, is infallible; For he may Teach to day as one <hi>lawfully ſent,</hi> and to morrow erre by ignorance, yea, and Malice alſo: But the Pope, conſidered as Pope and <hi>Chriſts</hi> Vicar on Earth can never Define in Councils but <hi>Infallibly;</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Aſſiſtance is in a higher meaſure certain, and ſupereminently <hi>Infallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The laſt ground of this Doctrin (which great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines<note place="margin">The whole Church conſiſting of Paſtors &amp;c. is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</note> aſſert) is, That the whole Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which conſiſts of Paſtors and Hearers, of Teachers and Learners, <hi>Antecedently</hi> to Pope and Council <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliarily</hi> aſſembled together, is infallible; For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ever Aſſiſting the Church, Primarily belong to this whole <hi>moral Body,</hi> which cannot erre: Againſt <hi>this Church</hi> Hell gates ſhall <hi>never prevail,</hi> with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102687:28"/> it <hi>The Spirit of Truth shall re main foor ever,</hi> &amp;c. Now this Infallibility cannot but remain and ſtand faſt in the members of this myſtical Body; not in Paſtors only, for it avails little, that Theſe teach infallibly, if none learn their infallible Doctrin: nor in Hearers only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they learn not infallible Doctrin without a <hi>Teacher.</hi> Infallibility then accompanies both Paſtors and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.<note place="margin">How Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Hearers are infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> As therfore, Theſe believing Hearers (conjoyned in Faith with this infallible Church) are under <hi>That notion,</hi> infallible, (no Catholick can deny it:) ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe theſe Believing Paſtors, as conjoynd <hi>in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin</hi> with this <hi>unerring Church,</hi> and Teaching what the Church Teaches, under <hi>that notion,</hi> are infallible in their Doctrin. Yet, as. I now intimated, there is a great Difference between the <hi>Repreſentative</hi> Church of a Pope and Council lawfully and <hi>Conciliarily</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and particular Paſtors, Particular Chriſtians, and Particular Churches; For, the Repreſentative<note place="margin">Particular Paſtors may erre.</note> Church, becauſe of the powerful Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, cannot ſwerve from Truth in its Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but this Paſtor, that Teacher, that Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church may ſwerve (altogether cannot) though under the <hi>notion of a Paſtor ſent</hi> to teach the Infallible Doctrin of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Church, he Teaches infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Separate him from this moral Body, he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Aſſiſtance, and cannot but teach Fallibly, though he ſpeak Truth by chance; conſequently he is none of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Teachers, for <hi>Christ</hi> never impowred any to teach <hi>Fallible Doctrin, that may be falſe.</hi> You will ſay, ſeparate a Miniſter from the Truth of the Goſpel, and he is alſo no Teacher. Alas, he ſeparat's him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; For, he hath no Miſſion to preach as he doth,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102687:28"/> and moreover Profeſſeth that he can teach nothing <hi>infallibly.</hi> But of this more afferward: In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To cut of all reply to the Argument, I propoſe it thus. No man that is by nature lyable to errour, or wants God's ſpecial Divine Aſſiſtance in his tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and Poſitively renounceth all infallible Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Chriſtian Teachers, can teach with certainty <hi>Chriſts</hi> Infallible Doctrin. But all men, now at leaſt in being, are by nature lyable to errour, want this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Aſſiſtance in their Teaching, and muſt (as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> will have it) poſitively renounce all infallible So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of Chriſtian Teachers; Therfore no man can Teach with certainty, or deliver the Infallible Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Major is evident: For he who by nature is lyable to errour, and hath not infallible<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Men want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to teach, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deliver</hi> Chriſts <hi>Doctrin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly.</hi>
                  </note> Aſſiſtance to Teach infallibly, or wants the Guidan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of an infallible Society to Direct him, may as eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly erre and miſſe in his teaching, as <hi>hit right</hi> on the Infallible Doctrin of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Minor is granted by <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poole;</hi> For all Churches; whether Roman or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, Arian or Grecian, are lyable to errour, want ſpecial Aſſiſtance in their Teaching, and ought poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to renounce all Societies of infallible Chriſtian Teachers; Therfore, the concluſion undeniably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, which is, That none can with certainty Teach the Infallible Doctrin of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And from hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce alſo followes an utter ruin of Chriſtian Religion (yea and of Scripture too) as I ſhall hereafter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate. For if all Paſtors, all Doctors, all Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Chriſtian Religion may erre in the Delivery of their Doctrin, all Learners of it, may likewiſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102687:29"/> erre in Hearing it; and if ſo, we have no certainty, That God is now Adored in Spirit and Truth by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Teacher,</hi> or <hi>Hearer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. The ultimate reaſon, why a Total ruin of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian<note place="margin">The utter ruin of Chriſtian Religion followes the fallible Teaching of it in a whole Church. What all Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koured for.</note> Religion accompanieth the fallible Teaching of it, is thus proved. None can teach Chriſtian Faith, that doth not Propoſe, or make Almighty God to be the Author of it, And therfore our Saviour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 16. told the Iewes, That his Doctrin <hi>was not his, but his Fathers that ſent him,</hi> Yea, The Prophets alſo, and all other Evangelical Preachers, chiefly laboured in this, to perſwade their Hearers, that God was the Author of that Doctrin they taught. Now ſay I: None can Propoſe or make God the Author of Chriſtian Faith, that doth not own it as a <hi>Doctrin aſſerted</hi> by his <hi>Eternal Veracity</hi> infallibly revealing Truth (for this is the <hi>Formal Object</hi> of Chriſtian Faith;) But He that only Teaches fallible Doctrin, which may be falſe, deſerts this <hi>Formal Object,</hi> and can neither own God for the Author of it, nor his infallible <hi>revealing Verity: Ergo,</hi> he muſt own a fallible Authority to uphold this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, which is utterly Deſtructive of Chriſtian Faith. The reaſon will be yet more evidenced, if you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it after this manner. A Doctrine, which by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of all the Principles it hath is meerly fallible and<note place="margin">The laſt ground of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.</note> no more, may be ſalſe: But Chriſtian Doctrin, <hi>as it is Taught</hi> by all Paſtors and Miniſters of the Word, &amp;c. is thus fallible; <hi>Ergo</hi> it may be falſe: But, God never ſent <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, nor <hi>Chriſt</hi> his Apoſtles or any, to Teach a Doctrin that may be falſe; <hi>Ergo</hi> he ſent none to Teach a Doctrin or Religion that is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. I prove it. He ſent none to Teach any other
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102687:29"/> Doctrin, but that which is founded, and <hi>intrinſecally</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies on his Eternal infallible <hi>Verity</hi> revealing Truth: But ſuch a Doctrin can neither be falſe nor fallible. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this taught Doctrin is certain and infallible: For, to grant that God ſent Paſtors to teach a Doctrin which relies on his infallible Revelation, is to ſay, He aſſiſt's them to teach it <hi>infallibly.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. I Argue again thus. Suppoſing the promiſes of <hi>Chriſt</hi> made in Scripture, Gods Goodnes cannot oblige the whole moral Body of Chriſtians to believe a falſity, or to contradict his certain revealed Verities. But if all Paſtors and Doctors may erre in their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whilſt they teach Chriſtian Doctrin, God would<note place="margin">God cannot oblige us to believe a falſity.</note> as indifferently oblige us to believe a falſity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict his certain Verities, as to hear truth when by chance it is taught, which is contrary to his Goodnes. The firſt Propoſition is evident, and confeſſedly true; For our Adverſaries ſay, it is repugnant to all <hi>conceptions</hi> of Gods Goodnes to require of men, under pain of Damnation, to Believe ſomething <hi>as infallibly true,</hi> which is really falſe. The other alſo is as clear. For if all Paſtors, all Doctors, who have the charge of ſouls, may (becauſe fallible) as well Teach falſe Doctrin as true, as eaſily erre, as Deliver <hi>Chriſts</hi> pure Verities,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102687:30"/> Chriſtians are, by virtue of Gods Command already intimated, bound both to hear and obey them. <hi>Matth. 18. 17.

The Apoſtle command's us to <hi>imitate the Faith</hi> of theſe Paſtors and Teachers. From theſe and other innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable places of Scripture, known to all, I argue. What is poſſible may be reduced to Act, but it is poſſible, That all Paſtors and Teachers may erre, and Deliver falſe Doctrin to the Chriſtian world; and in caſe they do ſo, I am upon theſe plain expres Ordinances of God, obliged to Believe them. Therfore I muſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, although they Teach falſe Doctrin. And if ſo, God obligeth me to Believe a Falſity; or, which is a real Verity, I am forced to grant this undeniable Truth, that his All-ſeeing providence doth now, and ever will Preſerve a Church, whoſe Paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers are infallible in the Delivery of Chriſtian Doctrin. Without this certain eſtabliſhed Infallibility in ſome one or other Society of Believers, Chriſtianity is no more but a meer tottering, reeling, and uncertain Religion; yet I muſt liſten to it, whether Thoſe who teach it, ſtand or fall, that is, whether they erre or not, teach an impoſture or Truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To confirm this proof, I ask whether God, after he had delivered his own certain Verities infallibly, and made alſo (by his Divine Aſſiſtance) Thoſe firſt Maſters of the Goſpel, his Bleſſed Apoſtles, infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102687:30"/> in their Delivery of theſe Verities; whether then, I ſay in the enſuing ages he divorced himſelf from his<note place="margin">A queſtion propoſed to Sectaries.</note> Church, and withdrew all Special Aſſiſtance from it, or, yet continued that gracious favour to ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Doctors of a Chriſtian ſociety? If he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued that care and providence for the Direction of ſome Paſtors in Truth, Thoſe, becauſe ſo guided, are ſtill infallible in their Teaching. Contrary wiſe, if he abandoned that charge, and deprived all Paſtors for the Future of infallible Aſſiſtance, This woful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence followes. That Chriſtian Religion, once ſtrongly ſupported by Gods unerring Spirit, ever ſince the Apoſtles Preaching, hath loſt that Hold, and now ſtands tottering on no more ſteedy ground, then what the weak, mutable, and erring Sentiments of men can afford it. Now how unmeet theſe are for ſo great a charge, <hi>Salomon Sap.</hi> 9. 15. ſayes enough: <hi>Cogitationes mortalium timidae, &amp; incertae providentiae noſtrae.</hi> The cogitations of mortal men are fearful, and our Providence vncertain; yet ſo it is, (and here mark the hideous crime of Proteſtants) who firſt Divorce <hi>Chriſt</hi> from his Church, and violently pull Religion<note place="margin">How Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe,</note> from its center, which is Gods infallible directing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and then make all the taught Doctrin of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to lean and rely only upon mans weak, timid, ſtaggering, and errable conceptions. The proof is evident; for either it relyes on God, and ſo is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, or upon Humane reaſon, and therfore as This is various, Religion cannot but be changeable. Let then the world judge (I appeal to no other Tribunal) whether Chriſtians can be ſatisfied with this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortles Doctrin. <hi>All they can now learn from any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102687:31"/> Paſtor touching Religion, hath only mans weak Thought, and Reaſon for it;</hi> but no certain Aſſurance that God ſpeaks by theſe Paſtors, Becauſe all, and every one of them (left to themſelves) are fallible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I muſt proſecute this matter further, wherefore<note place="margin">Man too feeble to preſerve Chriſtian Doctrine in its purity,</note> I ſay this Truth boldly. It is above mans power and policy (weak and errable in his Conceptions) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and unchangably to ſupport, or carry on Age after Age the profound Doctrin of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in its Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive purity, without Divine <hi>Aſsiſtance.</hi> Wit alone (dazeled as we ſee in the ſearch of the moſt obvious things in nature) is inſufficient, either rightly to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate theſe high Myſteries of grace, or with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty to conuey them unto us in that exact ſenſe, as God once delivered them. The reaſon hereof is drawn from the <hi>ſublime Excellency</hi> of Chriſtian Religion,<note place="margin">Becauſe of its ſublime Excellency.</note> which being (as all know) a Doctrin of Gods own incomprehenſible Wiſdom, a Communication of his deepeſt Secrets, cannot but tranſcend the force of humane knowledge; it cannot but lye, as it were, in a region above the reach of weak Reaſon only, and ſtand at a great diſtance from our fallible Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes. Whence I argue thus. All light and knowledge, which flow from a fallible Power and capacity, cannot but be anſwerable to ſuch a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, <hi>id eſt, Deficient, uncertain, and Fallible:</hi> But all the light and knowledge, which Chriſtians now have from either Church or Paſtors, concerning this ſublime Doctrin of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Gods revealed Verities in Scripture, flow, and are derived from no other, but from a fallible capacity, which is mans errable and weak underſtanding; and not from Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102687:31"/> Aſſiſtance (who ſay our Proteſtants) hath withdrawn infallibility from the Church: <hi>Ergo,</hi> This taught Doctrin cannot but be <hi>Deficient, uncertain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fallible Doctrine is not</hi> Chriſts.</note> and <hi>Fallible.</hi> Grant this, and none can prudently rely on it, none can know by any Principle, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be true or falſe, none finally can own it for <hi>Chriſts</hi> certain Doctrin. Rob therfore the Church of its proper <hi>Dote,</hi> which is Divine Aſſiſtance; take from it the Spirit of <hi>infallibility,</hi> Cancel that Truth of the Goſpel, <hi>I have prayed for thee, Peter, that thy Faith fail not;</hi> Deſtroy that impregnable Rock, wheron Chriſtianity is founded, <hi>Matt. 15.

Alas! might wit alone tamper with Gods Truths at pleaſure, might it turn Religion into as many Forms or ſhapes as weak Reaſon often conceives, This too <hi>unskilful Maſter</hi> would, as Fancies and judgements are various, now build, now deſtroy, now add, now ſubtract, now make, now marr, and bring in more confuſion into Chriſtinianity, then the wiſeſt men are able to redreſſe.

Thus much we ſe evidently, not only in the old<note place="margin">Mans with the cauſe of errours.</note> Philoſophers, who, led on by their weak Diſcours and gueſſes, groſly miſtook in their Opinions concerning Beatitude; but in ſome learned Fathers alſo (witnes a<note place="margin">Examples of it.</note>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102687:32"/> world, becauſe they left the Guidance of the Church, and relyed too much on their private Judgements, fell, as we know, into deplorable errours. But moſt of all this miſery is viſible in all condemned Haereticks, as <hi>Arians, Pelagians,</hi> and <hi>Neſtorians</hi> (witty and learned enough) but Becauſe wit too boldly entred into Divine Myſteries, and meddled with matters above its ſtrength, theſe men loſt themſelves; and here was the ſole cauſe<note place="margin">Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves his Curch from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> of their Ruin and falling from Truth.

               <p n="5">5. To prevent therfore this great <hi>Evil,</hi> the wiſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence<note place="margin">Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence over his Church.</note> of God (who well foreſaw mans weaknes and Inſtability) firſt Delivered his own eternal Truths in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly; (none doubts of this.) Next, he cauſed theſe Truths to be taught infallibly by the firſt Maſters of the Goſpel, his choſen Diſciples; here of alſo there is no doubt with our modern men. Moreover, Becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe his real Intention was, That not only the Primitive Chriſtians, ſhould exactly receive thoſe revealed Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities from infallible <hi>Teachers;</hi> but others alſo in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing

A more ſpiteful Blow therfore cannot be given to God, a greater Chimaera cannot be thought on, then to grant, as Sectaries do, that his All ſeing wiſdom firſt founded a Church upon infallible Teachers, and next to ſpoile all with this ungodly Aſſertion, viz: <hi>Afterward, when Chriſtians as much ſtood in need of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Paſtors for their Direction</hi> (becauſe of emergent Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies) <hi>then it was, He withdrew Aſſiſtance from them,</hi> Abandoned his charge, and left a whole Church to the wavering, timid, and uncertain Sentiments of meer erring men, who altogether, becauſe by nature fallible, might as eaſily (without this ſuperiour gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of infallibility) have taught groſſe errours, as the Verities of Chriſtian Religion.

               <head type="sub">Replyes to theſe Arguments are anſwered.</head>
               <p n="1">1. ONe perhaps may be. God ſurely will never permit all the Paſtors of Chriſtianity to erre and deceive the world: at leaſt this is no Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, They may erre, <hi>Ergo</hi> they do and will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually erre, for many things may be, which never will be. I anſwer, and many things actually happen, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer to Objections. </seg>
                  </label> which were never ſuſpected would be: and why may not this diffuſed Errour be one of them, who knows the contrary? In Proteſtants principles we have the greateſt Preſumption imaginable for this actual errour of all: For, they ſay, That ample and ancient Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all condemned Haereticks with it erred: ſet then theſe aſide, it is impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign plainly ſuch Chriſtian Teachers as never <hi>de facto</hi> erred. 2. The very poſſibility (yes and facility alſo) of All falling into Errour, makes the actuality of it fearfully doubtful, now men had been mad to looſe both Lives and Goods, to dye ignominiouſly on Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, for any doubtful and uncertain Doctrin. The Apoſtle put other thoughts in the primitive Martyrs hearts, other words in their mouths: <hi>Scio cui credidi, &amp; certus ſum.</hi> I know who I believe, and am certain. No Hearers therfore, can certainly rely on any doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and uncertain Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:102687:33"/>2. The ſecond reply. Admit that all Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors<note place="margin">Second Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</note> teach erroneous Doctrin, yet no great miſchief followes; for Thoſe who hear them are either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of the Falſity; And if ſo, they are not to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve their Teachers, or, They erre <hi>invincibly,</hi> which is a blameles Errour, and Therfore cannot in juſtice be held an Offence. The firſt part of the Reply ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes ſome inſtructed Chriſtians wiſer then all their <hi>Teachers</hi> together, which is an Impertinency never heard of. The ſecond touches not the difficulty; for here we blame not ſuch as may, perhaps, invincibly erre; But ſay, That the blame goes higher, and is unworthily caſt <hi>on God,</hi> who obliges Chriſtians to believe the Paſtors of a <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and yet gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves them ſuch diſabled ones, that all of them may erre univerſally, and teach Doctrin contrary to his revealed Truths. Here lyes the myſtery of iniquity, upheld<note place="margin">Proteſtants Myſtery of iniquity.</note> by Proteſtants, and the uglines of it appears in this wrethched Aſſertion: <hi>God will have me to believe a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; yet this whole Catholick Church, that is all the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">They caſt blame upon God.</note> 
                  <hi>Paſtors, all the Councils, all the Fathers, Doctors and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of this Church, may teach me ſuch falſe Doctrin as God never intended I should learn.</hi> They may, if fallible, teach us, that <hi>Christ</hi> is not God, that Heaven is not a place of Eternal Happines, nor Hell an abode of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal torments: Such Haereſies have been ſpread by Thoſe who went under the name of Chriſtians; and why may not, I beſeech you, all Chriſtian Paſtors abuſe the world as much, if Gods gracious ordinance, concerning the Churches infallibility, faill us?</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third reply: It is one Thing to teach Truth,<note place="margin">Teaching Truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly.</note> and another to teach it <hi>infallibly:</hi> Put therfore the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102687:34"/> That Almighty God foreſaw from Eternity, that though all Paſtors of the Church, <hi>potentiâ antecedente,</hi> antecedently might erre, yet ſome at leaſt, <hi>ex ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione conſequenti,</hi> or, <hi>conſequently,</hi> would not erre, but teach Chriſtian Verities faithfully. Suppoſe, I ſay, only thus much. We have ſufficient Aſſurance of Truth actually taught in the world, without that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious infallible Aſſiſtance we plead for, which ſeems here uſeles; for if either man or Angel Delivers a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it matters nothing, whether it ariſe from a Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible or infallible cauſe. Our Faith therfore hath ſtrength enough, if it rely on Truth actually Taught, though the Teacher wants infallibility. I anſwer: If God foreſaw, that all the Paſtors of his Church would not erre or teach falſe Doctrin, This Verity is either revealed to Chriſtians; as <hi>a Divine Truth,</hi> or no: if not, we make that revealed, which is not revealed, and conſequently can ground no Aſſurance on it: if it be revealed and known to us, this very Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz: All the Paſtors of the Church shall not erre,</hi> is an undoubted Principle, which, aſſented to by true Faith, is our Security, Becauſe ſuch a Faith ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the contrary <hi>Actual errour</hi> of all eſſentially exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by virtue of Gods Revelation; For it is impoſſible that God tell us this Truth. <hi>All the Paſtors of my Church shall not erre in any age,</hi> and yet, <hi>in ſenſu compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſito</hi> of this Revelation permit them to erre univerſally. Obſerve in one Inſtance the ſecurity we have by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of ſuch a Revelation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Suppoſe, that God had revealed to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that his Father <hi>Abraham</hi> would not ſacrifice him, and withall, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> firmly believed that Verity; He had
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102687:34"/> been as indubitably ſecured from dying at that time, as if <hi>Abrahams</hi> hands had been tyed in chains, or wholy made impotent to give a fatal blow. Now mark the Application. As Gods Eternal Previſion of <hi>Abrahams</hi> not taking <hi>Iſaacs</hi> life away, Antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſed the cauſe therof actually alſo foreſeen (antecedently, I ſay, in a foregoing <hi>ſigne oſ nature</hi>) ſo likewiſe it is in our preſent caſe, when from Eternity he knew, that all the Paſtors of his Church would not actually err, and revealed this Truth in time; His All-ſeing wiſdom Previouſly, <hi>pro priori ſigno ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> foreſaw alſo the total cauſe of their actual <hi>not Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> which cauſe (as I have already proved) was not the power of mans weak, variable, and miſtaking Reaſon; But the moſt certain Principle of Gods ſpecial and Divine Aſſiſtance. When therfore God (as the Objection ſuppoſeth) revealed that <hi>Verity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All shall not err,</hi> he did not only, by virtue of his Revelation, impoſſibilitate the contrary univerſal er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, bur warranted more, that, all of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe prevented by ſpecial Aſſiſtance, could not er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. And this is what Scripture Energitically tells us, of <hi>Hell gates not prevailing againſt the Church,</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Being with the Church to te end of the world;</hi> wherof mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re hereafter. In the interim you ſee; that Chriſtian<note place="margin">Chriſtian Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies on Truth taught by an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Oracle.</note> Faith doth not only rely on a meer contingent (or <hi>hap hazard</hi>) Delivery of Truth; but on Truth, taught by an Aſſiſted and infallible <hi>Oracle,</hi> which All muſt aſſert, or grant, that although <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by a ſuppoſed Impoſſibility, had been fallible in<note place="margin">
                     <hi>No certitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of Truth had</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and his Apoſtles taught it Fallibly.</hi>
                  </note> his Preaching, or the Apoſtles likewiſe fallible in Their writting Scripture, and only (becauſe lyable
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102687:35"/> to errour, had delivered Gods Verities contingently, by chance, Chriſtian Religion might yet have ſtood as firme and unſhaken as now it is, which is a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, and an unheard of <hi>Haereſy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. A fourth reply: We cannot prove by good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (if we ſet aſide ſome ambiguous Paſſages of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which only ſeemingly ſay the contrary) that the immediate Proponent of true certain Chriſtian Faith (Catholiks ſay 'Tis the Church) ought to be certain and infallible. It ſeems enough, ſay ſome, that this Faith be taught upon a rational Evidence, which Evidence, finally reſolved, comes to no more but to a <hi>Moral certainty.</hi> Theſe (as I am informed) ground themſelves on this Principle, That all the Aſſurance we can have of Chriſtian Religion, hath for its whole Foundation <hi>moral Certainty</hi> only, and it ſeems a prop firm enough to ſupport it. More it cannot have.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Objection contains two parts. To the firſt I anſwer: If Divine Faith be in the world, Reaſon<note place="margin">Divine Faith muſt have an infallibie Teacher.</note> convinceth, that the object of it be propounded by a Certain and infallible <hi>Teacher,</hi> and then moſt, when Points fundamental lye under Diſpute, and are in controverſy. Faith therfore requires two things eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, (to omit other Neceſſaries) an Object, which is Gods <hi>Revelation,</hi> and a Propoſition of this object made by ſome Teacher to Chriſtians, which Doctrin the Apoſtle ratifies, <hi>Rom. 10. 15. How shall they hear without a Preacher.</hi> By virtue of this <hi>Propoſition</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we call it Cauſe, or an Eſſential Condition) the Elicite Act of Faith followes in a Believer, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectually layes, as it were hold, both on Gods
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102687:35"/> Revelation and the Thing revealed. Obſerve now well. Gods Revelation (none doubts it) is certain and infallible. Divine Faith, which reſteth on this Motive, and proceeds from Grace, is alſo certain and infallible. The only Difficulty remaining, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns this <hi>Proponent</hi> of Faiths Object, and it is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther He that Directs me, and endeavours rightly to ſettle my Faith upon Gods infallible Revelation, do his work with aſſurance, fallibly, or infallibly.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I ſay firſt. Gods infallible Revelation avail's nothing in order to Faith, unles Chriſtians by their Faith lay hold on the Certainty therof, or own it as infallible, and the aſſured ground of their Aſſent. The reaſon is. Becauſe God ſpeaks infallibly to Chriſtians for this End, That his infallible Word may have influence into Faith, and ſupport in with Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. If therefore this revealed Word be not Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Propoſed (as it is) infallible, if it be not due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applyed to a Believers underſtanding, under its<note place="margin">The object of Faith muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</note> own Notion of certainty, that ſtrength of infallibility lyes as it were dead, without Operation, and profits Belief no more, then Food doth a Body into which it cannot enter. The ſimilitude is fit: For as Food, though apt to ſtrengthen a Body, is juſt as if it were not, unles it be duely Applyed; ſo Gods Certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, though moſt Proportionate to ſtrengthen a Soul in Faith, yet in order to this Effect, it looſeth all Efficacy, while a due Application of its <hi>infallibility</hi> is wanting.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To illuſtrate more this neceſſary Truth; I ſay ſecondly. When a Revelation lyes darkly in Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, as it often doth in High points of Controverſy,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102687:36"/> according to the meaſure or degrees of Certitude, which the Proponent of Faith gives to the Revelation, and ſaith, <hi>God ſpeaks thus,</hi> An Aſſent anſwerably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes with like Certitude in the Hearer, and not a ſtronger. If therfore the Proponent only ſay Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, <hi>I think God ſpeak's as I preach, but am not Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gods Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation is received according as 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> 
                  <hi>Doubtful alſo is the Aſſent given to this Preaching.</hi> If he ſay, What I teach is Probable, <hi>The Aſſent can be no more but Probable.</hi> If finally He truely ſay, <hi>I teach Infallibly what is revealed, the Aſſent Anſwers, and is Infallible.</hi> The reaſon is clear. For, as no Eye can ſee Colours in darknes before light makes them viſible, yea, and according to the meaſure of light it ſee's them: ſo no Intellectual Eye can diſcover <hi>a dark Revelation,</hi> before he borrow light from his Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and as The light is leſſe or more, ſo He ſee's that object leſſe, or more perfectly. A dubious and uncertain <hi>Propoſal</hi> therfore, made of a <hi>certain Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> when it doth not Clearly manifeſt it ſelf, is like a <hi>glimmering light,</hi> And neither doth, nor can apply the <hi>Objective infallibility</hi> Therof with Aſſurance to mans intellectual Faculty, which yet ſeek's after Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in matters of Belief. This needs no proof. For he who propoſeth only Doubfully a Revelation, which is Certain in it ſelf, both in <hi>actu ſignato,</hi> and <hi>exercito,</hi> ſaith no more but <hi>timidly</hi> thus much: Perhaps <hi>I decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A timide propoſal of Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation begets no more but a doubtfull Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>what God ſpeak's,</hi> and perhaps <hi>I do not: For my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration only Doubfully gueſſes at the Certainty of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> And it is againſt the nature of all Doubt to convey Certainty into any underſtanding. As long therfote as the <hi>infallibility</hi> of a Revelation ſtands remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te from me, For want of an undoubted Application
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102687:36"/> made by an <hi>infallible Proponent,</hi> it can no more trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Certainty into Faith, then fire, at a great diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, warm, That is, no more <hi>Then if it were not Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in it ſelf, or not at all in Being.</hi> Whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. That a certain Revelation (if obſcure in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) requires a Certain Propoſition, Becauſe It little avail's me to know this truth, <hi>That if God ſpeak's, he ſpeak's infallibly, unles, hîc &amp; nunc, in theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce when he ſpeak's to me for my Saluation, I yeild my cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Aſſent to the infallibility of his Word,</hi> which cannot be done, unles I have Aſſurance from my Teacher, that he ſpeak's (as I ought to believe) <hi>infallibly.</hi> Upon theſe undeniable Principles I ſay, thirdly. Our<note place="margin">Sectaries can have no Divine Faith.</note> Sectaries can do no more but doubtfully gueſſe at what they Believe, and conſequently (as Proteſtants) never yet had, nor can have Divine, certain, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Faith. I prove the Aſſertion. All Faith, which hath no other Certitude, then what is derived from Thoſe, who propound the object of it (<hi>id eſt,</hi> Gods Revelation) <hi>uncertainly</hi> and <hi>doubtfully,</hi> is no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re <hi>but wavering, Opinative</hi> and <hi>doubtful.</hi> But the Faith of Proteſtants is evidently ſuch, Becauſe no man, or Society of men amongſt them, can without doubt and fear infallibly ſay: <hi>God ſpeak's as I preach, and I infallibly preach as God ſpeaks;</hi> For, if he averr thus much with Truth, he Propound's the object of his Faith infallibly, and therfore is ſo farre infallible. If he do<note place="margin">They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not propoſe Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly.</note> not, his preaching muſt be finally reſolved into his own timid, weak, and wavering Opinion, which weighed, comes to no more but this Levity. <hi>I hope well, and think I preach what God hath infallibly Revealed, yet am not certain, becauſe all I ſay,</hi> (for ought I know) <hi>is fallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:102687:37"/>9. If you will ſe this Truth farther Evidenced, do no more but ask of any Proteſtant, Why, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, He believes that all the <hi>Churches on earth are falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? That Chriſt is only figuratively in the Euchariſt? That Faith only juſtifies? That there are two Sacraments and no more, &amp;c.</hi> His firſt refuge perhaps will be to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. But demand again. Whether Scripture in <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>Expreſſ Terms,</hi> Delivers theſe ſuppoſed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins? If he be not more then impudent, he muſt ſay, No. All therfore he can reply, is, That the Miniſters of his Church, after a peruſal of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, find theſe Verities contained there, and Propoſe all to him as things <hi>Certainly revealed,</hi> Therfore he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves them. Here we come to the trial of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants Faith, and mark well, How unavoydably They are forced to grant, <hi>That when a pretended Revelation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sectaries muſt own an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</note> 
                  <hi>is not manifeſt for them, But lyes (if at all) very darkly in Scripture, it muſt be brought to light, and made more clear by ſome Teacher.</hi> Some one or other (if it have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into Faith) muſt Apply it and Propoſe it to a Hearer, <hi>as Gods certain Word.</hi> Without this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication made by a certain Teacher, no Chriſtian can (<hi>but most temerariouſly</hi>) admit of the Revelation, as <hi>Divine,</hi> and <hi>Certain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Demand therfore in the laſt place, Whether all the Miniſters in England are able to propound <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</hi> and <hi>infallibly</hi> the above mentioned Doctrins (dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at leaſt, and indeed, not all contained in Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re) as Gods revealed Truths to any? The anſwer muſt be Negative. They cannot (for if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them infallibly, Miniſters are infallible) <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſay I, none can Believe theſe Doctrins for Gods cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102687:37"/> Revelation, Becauſe the <hi>Propoſal</hi> of them (abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to apply the Revelation) is <hi>defective, weak, dubious</hi> and <hi>uncertain.</hi> The Faith therfore, which followes upon ſo unſteedy a Teaching, cannot but be anſwerably rowling, That is in one word, no <hi>Faith at all. And Proteſtants have no better.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Some perhaps may ſay: Though Proteſtants have no great Certainty of the Doctrins above ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, becauſe they are neither expreſly in Scripture, nor Aſſerted by any infallible Teacher, yet their Faith in <hi>Fundamentals</hi> (univerſally held by all Chriſtians) ſtand's ſure enough, and is infallible. Such Truths ſhall never fail, and ſo far the Paſtors of the Church may, it is likely, be held infallible.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Hereafter we ſhall treat more largely of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental points, and Therfore at preſent will wave what is not pertinent to anſwer this Reply. And perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent<note place="margin">Why Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Proteſta as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants is uncertain.</note> it is to ſay firſt: That not one Doctrin peculiar to Proteſtants, (as Proteſtants) becauſe neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly found in Scripture, nor Aſſerted by any infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Teacher, can certainly be believed upon <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> That theſe Sectaries teach not their own Proteſtant Tenents infallibly, is granted. That Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth not in <hi>expreſſ Terms,</hi> without intolerable gloſſing, deliver one of them, ſhall be made, after a few pages, moſt evident; And thus, if this laſt Reply be to any purpoſe, it brings Ruin to that part of Doctrin which is called <hi>Proteſtancy.</hi> I ſay ſecondly, There is ſcarce one Article of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Sacred Doctrin, ſo clearly expreſſed in Scripture, which may not, would men take the liberty, as Sectaries do, by wilful Gloſſes to alienate it from the Churches ſenſe, be perverted.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102687:38"/> 
                  <hi>Arians</hi> have taught them this mode of Gloſſing, and they exactly follow it. Separate therfore the words<note place="margin">Doubful words of Scripture, ſeparated from the ſenſe of an Infallible Interpreter, ground not Faith.</note> of Scripture from the <hi>Senſe of an infallible</hi> Interpreter, we can Believe nothing, we have no more but <hi>a body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> a Soul, <hi>gueſſes without certainty.</hi> And upon ſuch uncertainties the whole Faith of Proteſtants doth and muſt rely, which is deplorable. And here ask them, when They appeal (as They ever doe) to Scripture, What they mean by Scripture, which needs Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, even in Points moſt Fundamental. Muſt we admit of their Interpretation? Why ſo, more then of others as learned as They? Why not as well on the preſent Churches Interpretation? This is as good (to ſay no more) as their fallible Gueſſes are. But of this Subject hereafter. I ſay thirdly. Never<note place="margin">The Church in all her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine equally infallible.</note> any Catholick Church hitherto held it ſelf infallible in a few Fundamental Doctrins, and not in others. Therfore Proteſtants are more inſolently bold, whilſt they attempt to make this Diſtinction, then ever any Church yet was. What? That meer fallible Men ſhall be my Doctors, and <hi>ex tripode</hi> define, So far the Church holds infallible Doctrin, But no further, T'would be well nigh <hi>eight Degrees</hi> of madnes in me, to believe them. Admit once of this: A new Haeretick may ſtep out, and defend as ſtoutly, yea, and upon as ſolid grounds, that Scripture it ſelf it not infallible, but only in a few Fundamental Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yet unknown to the world. If you ſay this ſounds too harſhly, and cannot be granted. Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel I beſeech you, your own wild Aſſertion with it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Church is</hi> Chriſt's <hi>Schole.</hi>
                  </note> and ſe whether that runs much ſmoother. Thus it is. <hi>Chriſt hath erected a School, which is his Church,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102687:38"/> where Chriſtians are to learn his Sacred Doctrin: But when they come to it, They find more then the half of its Doctrin doubtful, fallible, unſound, uncertain.</hi> Alas! <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> or <hi>Plato's</hi> School can cfford us Topicks, and uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties enough: I hope <hi>Chriſts</hi> School can learn us better. Fourthly. Were the Church falſly ſuppoſed Fallible in the delivery of ſome Doctrin leſſe Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, it would be much ſafer to believe it, <hi>then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> who may err in all they ſay, And then moſt, when being void of proofs, They ſtand trifling with a Diſtinction of <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> and not <hi>Fundamentals.</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein as in all other things, they are moſt fallible, and muſt I, think ye, credit men, that can ſay nothing <hi>certainly?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. Fifthly, and I end: Admit once of a Church with this half infallibility in fundamentals; our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries, who ſo furiouſly oppugn that whole infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which we aſcribe to the Roman Church, muſt Anſwer their own Arguments againſt us. For here we queſtion them. as they do us. <hi>Where or in what</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rational Queries made to Proteſtants.</note> 
                  <hi>Subject is that partial infallibility lodged? What Paſtors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignable are endewed with it? How shall we make our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to them in doubts and difficulties,</hi> if none know where, or who they are? <hi>What kind of infallibility is this? By whoſe aſſured Teſtimony can we learn what is de fide funaamentali, what not? What if theſe Paſtors be devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongst themſelves in their Deciſions of fundameetals, whoſe judgement is finally to be ſtood too,</hi> &amp;c.? Theſe and the like Queſtions, moſt eaſily anſwer'd by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, when They give an account of their Belief (as I ſhall ſhew in the Reſolution of Faith) preſſ ſo ſtrongly upon Proteſtants, that not one of them
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102687:39"/> ſhall ever have a ſatisfactory Anſwer. Perhaps to<note place="margin">Proteſtants pretence to a private Spirit.</note> ſolve them, ſome will recurre to the private Spirit, and ſay, This tell's them all Truth in theſe doubts. <hi>Contra.</hi> Ask only here: Whether this Spirit <hi>makes them or their Pastors infallible,</hi> or can direct others to find out ſuch infallible Paſtors? If they reply: Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe are ſuch, as Teach Gods Word purely; the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is impertinent, for we ask whether it Aſſiſts any to Teach Gods pure Word <hi>infallibly,</hi> And who they are? It may be others will ſay, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> never had ſince the Apoſtles time, any infallible Church on earth even in fundamentals, All therfore we have now to Direct us, is only the book of Scripture (without other Proponent) and every mans private Reaſon. <hi>Contra.</hi> It is Evident, That Scripture makes no man infallible, both <hi>Arians</hi> and Others read it, and yet groſly err in Points moſt Eſſential. Deny therfore a Church unerrable in Eſſentials, and ſay boldly, that as <hi>Arians</hi> have already erred in ſome Fundamentals, ſo others might before this day have wholy erred, and outed both <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Creed,</hi> with every Article of Chriſtian Religion. For <hi>weak Reaſon</hi> alone, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient. to Preſerve Chriſtianity in its Purity, as I have ſhewed above, wherof alſo more hereafter.</p>

And thus<note place="margin">Mr. Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling fleet.</note> ſome later men Diſcours concerning the certainty of Chriſtian Religion. They ſay firſt, (and moſt true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) That the <hi>ultimate Motive</hi> wheron Faith relyes, is Gods infallible Teſtimony, with all, That none can queſtion the fallibility of this Revealed Teſtimony, when it is <hi>Sufficiently propoſed,</hi> and made known to us. The only Queſtion therfore is, How it comes to be made known, or, diſcovered in order to thoſe things<note place="margin">Proteſtants Doctrine about Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</note> which are immediatly Revealed. They ſay ſecondly. <hi>Moral certainty may be a ſufficient foundation For the most firm aſſent, if the matter to be believed, be the infallible Truth of a Doctrin, upon ſutable Evidence. Though we have now but Moral Certainty of that Evidence,</hi> The <hi>Aſſent may yet be</hi> firm to <hi>ſuch a Doctrin, as infallible.</hi> They ſay thirdly: Moral Certainty may be as great as <hi>Mathematical</hi> and <hi>Phyſical, ſuppoſing as little reaſon to doubt in moral things as to their natures,</hi> as in <hi>Mathematical</hi> and <hi>Phyſical, as to Theirs.</hi> Here briefly is their Doctrin. Some further Explications of it, will perhaps more opportunely ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve place, while we make our Exception againſt it. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. My firſt Exception is. Theſe Authors do not
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102687:40"/> ſufficiently explain what they would have here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by <hi>Moral certainty,</hi> wherin there is a great Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. One Degree of it excludes all Rational doubt.<note place="margin">Degrees of Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</note> And thus we ſay: He, who never ſaw <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> may yet upon the indubitable Teſtimony of ſo many witneſſes, who have ſeen it, affirm without fear, There is, or hath been ſuch a Citty in the world. An other Degree of this Certitude reaches not ſo high, As <hi>we ſe in School Opinions.</hi> Some Philoſophers Tell you, it is Morally certain, That ſublunary Bodies, as Fire and water, are compoſed of Matter and Form. That Accidents are really diſtinct from Subſtance and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet now there are ſome, that deny it, and hold, as they think, a contrary Philoſophy more <hi>Morally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> Therfore, when we come to apply this Moral certainty to Diſputable matters, we do ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver agree about it. I doubt not, but Theſe very men, we now treat with, will ſay (what They jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, God knowes) that, That part of Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, wherin it differ's from all Chriſtians, is upon Moral Certainty True, yet the Reſt of the world op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them, and Avouches it hath not ſo much as one Degree of <hi>Probability</hi> for it, That therfore, which is here meant by Moral certitude, muſt, if theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſpeak to the purpoſe, be a Certainty, wherof no man can Rationally doubt. Thus much ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſay firſt, (and by this Aſſertion you may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the grand Cheat of theſe Novelliſts) Chriſtian<note place="margin">A grand Cheat of Navelliſts diſcover'd.</note> Religion as it is <hi>fancied,</hi> and <hi>variouſly Profeſſed</hi> by innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, who go under <hi>that</hi> name and <hi>Notion,</hi> hath ſo little of this Great Moral Certainty for it, <hi>That it is

You wil ſay, No. But they had it for the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of Chriſtian Religion, wherof no man ever doubted, and thus much they Defend upon that Certitude.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102687:41"/> This is that which only requires proof, and is the thing we Abſolutly deny.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Again, (And here is my ſecond Exception) Theſe Authors cannot apply their Moral certainty to the <hi>Faith</hi> of any Religion, that beares the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. At leaſt, it is neither appliable to Catholicks, nor Proteſtants. For proof hereof, Note firſt: That mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral<note place="margin">Two Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de on Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</note> Certainty taken in what Height you pleaſe, is an Act of the Judicative Power in man, <hi>ſubjectively</hi> ſetled in his Mind, who hath it, And ever falles on a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Object, (for in Objects, <hi>à parte rei,</hi> there is neither Probability, nor moral Certainty.) Every Thing imaginable being either in it ſelf Real and Stable, or not, independent of any Moral Aſſertion: As is clear, For ſhould one ſay now: <hi>It is morally certain, that there is ſuch a Citty as Rome in the World; Rome</hi> is, or is not, independent of what is aſſerted morally Certain. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ſecondly. Though the greateſt Moral certainty<note place="margin">Moral Certainty may be Falſe.</note> uſually excludes a rational doubt in order to what is aſſerted certain; <hi>yet in rigour it may be falſe, And Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever implyes ſome weak Degree of Fear, of anxiety, and ſuſpicion</hi> to the contrary. Had any one ſaid a few dayes before the Burning of <hi>London</hi> (little then fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that ſad Diſaſter) that, That Noble Citty would not in ſo ſtrange a manner be conſumed with fire, He would have been thought to have uttered a Truth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally certain, yet the contrary doleful Effect proved it untrue. And the like may happen now, while we upon Moral Certainty Say, <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Constantinople</hi> are Citties in Being. Theſe Grounds ſuppoſed,</p>
               <p n="5">5. I ſay firſt. Whoever, when he Affirm's, that Chriſtian Religion is only Morally Certain, and hath
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102687:41"/> for <hi>the Object of his Affirmation,</hi> that which Eſſentially<note place="margin">Moral Certainty only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy's the Being of Chriſtian Religion.</note> conſtitutes Religion, I mean true <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Faith,</hi> highly wrongs Chriſtian Religion, yea, and deſtroyes the very <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Eſſence</hi> of it. I prove it. The Certainty of Divine Faith, is as farre above, and diſtant from all the Degrees of Moral Certitude (which may be falſe) as Heaven is from Earth, and more. Therfore he who allowes no greater Certainty to true Faith then Moral, which may be falſe, deſtroyes both<note place="margin">Certainty of Faith farre above Moral Certainty.</note> the <hi>Life and Eſſence</hi> of Chriſtian Religion. That the Certainty of Faith farre ſurpaſſeth all the Degrees of Moral Certitude, is Demonſtrable upon Principles, granted as well by Orthodox Chriſtians, as by our Adverſaries, who ſay, That true Faith dot not only affirm, That what God Reveales is moſt Certain (for thus much, ſuppoſing a God, we know by Science, were there no Faith) but by Faith we affirm without fear at all: <hi>God ſpeaks Thus and Thus. He reveales that the Divine Word took flesh. That Chriſt dyed for us. That there is a Trinity of Perſons in one Divine eſſence &amp;c.</hi> Such Truths, we already own as Delivered by one, who neither can, nor will Deceive us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence I argue. The Sole and Adequate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Divine and Supernatural Faith, is Gods infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Veracity, which Actually ſpeak's to us, and is lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to no errour.

               <p n="7">7. From this undoubted Ground. I inferre alſo,<note place="margin">Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Faith more Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then Metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Science.</note> 
                  <hi>That Supernatural Faith is more Certain and infallible, then all the Metaphyſical Science, which Nature can give us.</hi> It is true, Metaphyſical Science hath more of the <hi>Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi> and therfore excludes all indeliberate Fear or Doubt to the contrary (for no man can ſo much as <hi>indelibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely</hi> Doubt, whether a whole Citty be greater then one Houſe;) But for Abſolute Certainty, and Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible <hi>Adheſion,</hi> Faith yet ſurpaſſeth it. The Reaſon<note place="margin">The Energy of Faiths Motive.</note> is; Becauſe the Infinite Veracity of God, which only ſupporteth Faith, <hi>Majori vi, with greater Force, Energy, and Neceſsity transfuſeth into it a Supereminent Infallibility, ſupereminent,</hi> I ſay, and above all the Certainty, which Principles of nature can afford. As therfore this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Veracity ſurpaſſeth all Created certainty, ſo Faith, which relyes on it, goes beyond all Natural and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour certainty. Upon this Principle we ſee firſt, How Divinely the Apoſtle ſpoke: <hi>Licet nos &amp;c.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we or Angel from Heaven <hi>preach contrary &amp;c.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102687:42"/> Let him be accurſed.</hi> And, how wel <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Chryſoſtome</hi> delivered himſelf, when He ſaith, <hi>Hom.</hi> 12.

If Proteſtants Diſown it, They have no <hi>Faith,</hi> no, nor ſo much as a Belief <hi>Morally certain,</hi> wherof more preſently. We ſee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly. How the <hi>very Eſſence</hi> of Chriſtian Religion is deſtroyed, if we make Faith no more but <hi>Morally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi> which is, what I intended to Prove.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Perhaps, Theſe Authors will tell us: When they<note place="margin">Religion founded on Moral Certainty confuted.</note> Aſſert Chriſtian Religion to be founded on Moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, Their Aſſertion fall's not immediatly <hi>upon the Aſſent of Divine Faith,</hi> which is firm and certain; But rather upon the Object of it <hi>Antecedently applyed</hi> to us Before we believe; wherof we can have no greater Aſſurance, then what is Moral. And it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; For, ſay They, There can be had no greater then Moral certainty of the main Foundations of all Religion, which are the <hi>Being of God,</hi> and <hi>the Soules Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</hi> To quarrel therfore with Moral certainty is Madnes, when the Foundation of all Religion is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of no more. By the way, if this be Madnes, I ſe very little Wiſdom in ſome, who, to oppugne the Churches infallibility (proved as they ſuppoſe by motives of Credibility only <hi>morally certain</hi>) Ring out
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102687:43"/> nothing but Peales of <hi>Impoſsibilities,</hi> and ſay it cannot be That the Aſſent to a matter Believed, Riſe higher or ſtand firmer, then the Aſſent, which is given to the Teſtimony wheron we Believe. But the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the Church is the thing Believed, upon the Teſtimony of Motives, at moſt but <hi>Morally</hi> certain; Therfore we cannot Believe this with a ſtronger De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of certainty, then thoſe Motives give us, which afford at moſt but Moral certainty. If this Diſcours be good, I argue thus, <hi>Ad hominem.</hi> No greater certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have Chriſtians now Antecedently to their Actual <hi>Belief,</hi> that God ſpeaks to them by either Scripture or Church, then that God <hi>is in Being;</hi> But the very <hi>Being of God</hi> is only known by Moral certainty; <hi>Ergo,</hi> that he ſpeaks to Chriſtians cannot be known antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Belief,</hi> by any greater Certitude, then what is Moral, and may deceive them. How then, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, comes the <hi>Elicite Act</hi> of Supernatural Faith unto ſuch a Height of Certainty, as not to Credit an Angel, if he Preach againſt it? Upon what Motive ſtands it ſo firm, when no other Certainty ſupports it, but only what is <hi>Moral,</hi> and may be falſe? The <hi>Medium</hi> is fallible, Therfore the Belief founded on it is no better, but Moral and fallible. Mark well your own Argument. 'Tis thus.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Motives of Credibility for Chriſtian Faith, Becauſe only known by Moral Certainty, cannot ground a certain Belief of any Churches Infallibility: <hi>Ergo,</hi> I ſay, The very Exiſtency of God and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, Becauſe only known by a <hi>Moral Certainty,</hi> cannot ground a firm Belief in God, or any Chriſtian Verity, unles you ſay, that Theſe Motives for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

               <p n="10">10. Now to the Reply. Though an exact Anſwer<note place="margin">An An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Reply.</note> cannot be well returned, without entring upon an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtion (the Reſolution of Faith) which here lyes out of the way, and Admit's not in this Place of a full and diligent Examination. I ſay firſt. <hi>No ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure intellectual Operation, which preced's Divine Faith, or is independent of it, can ariſe to thoſe Degrees of Certainty which this Supernatural Act requires.</hi> Admit then, that the Exiſtency of God (which is true) can be Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by natural Reaſon, Admit alſo, that thoſe ſtrong Motives for Chriſtian Religion <hi>Antecedently</hi> known by Humane Diſcours, demonſtratively convince the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it, yet becauſe Faith (as I now ſayd) Relyes upon a <hi>Superiour infallible Principle</hi> (Gods own <hi>unerrable Veracity</hi>) it far ſurmont's both theſe Certainties, and much more would it go beyond them, were they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102687:44"/> known <hi>as Moral Truths only.</hi> Why? A natural Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, wherby theſe Vetities are known, is Science; But no ſcience gives the laſt, or leaſt Degree of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick</hi>
                  <note place="margin">No Science gives the leaſt Degree of certitude to Faith.</note> Certitude to Faith; and Therfore Divines ſay: Gods Supream Verity, which ever ſupports Belief, upholds it not as known by <hi>natural Reaſon;</hi> For if it did, Faith would be at laſt reſolved into one <hi>natural Principle</hi> thus. <hi>I believe God to be the Highest Verity ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, not Becauſe he ſaith ſo, But becauſe I know this great Truth Scientifically,</hi> where you ſe, the laſt <hi>Analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> reſt's on an <hi>extrinſecal Principle</hi> of knowledge, with which Faith, as <hi>Faith,</hi> meddles not.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Thus much therfore is clear. Although the Motives of Credibility manifeſt (as they do) moſt <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly,</hi> that God ſpeak's to Chriſtians, yet, when we bring an Act of Faith by a true <hi>Analyſis</hi> to its <hi>Home</hi> and <hi>Center,</hi> we find it ever Reſting on Gods Veracity only, as the laſt <hi>Stay</hi> and moſt certain Motive.

In a word, They ſhew Chriſtian Religion to be either evidently Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or as ſome later Divines will have it, evidently True <hi>in Attestante.</hi> And if this be ſo, the formal Object of Chriſtian Faith is known, as it were <hi>Scienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically,</hi> either before, or when we Actually Believe, which ſeems grounded on thoſe words of the Apoſtle: <hi>Scio cui credidi, &amp; certus ſum: I know, and then believe certainly.</hi>

When He is thus diſpoſed and prepared to Believe by ſo firm an Evidence, The other Judgement of <hi>Elicite Faith</hi> followes, which tend's not into the Evidence of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Motives; for if it did ſo, <hi>under that Notion it would not be Faith;</hi> For Faith, <hi>as Faith,</hi> totally Relyes on Gods <hi>Sole Revelation,</hi> and for this, as the only <hi>Formal Object,</hi> a Chriſtian Believes what ever myſtery is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed after a due Propoſal; as is already Declared.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Some will ſay. The <hi>Elicite</hi> Act of Faith Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifically knowes not the Object wheron it Relyes, and therfore cannot be Certain. Anſwer.

               <p n="14">14. You will reply again. The Mode then and Tendency of Faith unto its Object is here ſuppoſed Obſcure, and that Previous judgement of Credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty after all poſſible weighing of thoſe Motives, which do manifeſt the Credibility of this Truth. <hi>God ſpeaks by the Church,</hi> is no more but Morally certain; <hi>Ergo</hi> the Belief of that Truth ſtands ſtill wavering upon <hi>Vncertainties.</hi> I anſwer.

               </p>
               <p n="15">15. This Judgement therfore which like an Interiour voyce (ſuppoſing the Exteriour Propoſition of the Church) ſummon's us to hear, or, like a Light that diſcover's Gods own Language delivered by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, makes the Language, once dark, clear enough to us.

Perhaps you will ſay. At leaſt we know not, that God ſpeaks to us, but only upon Moral certainty. Of this more preſently. Here the Reply is not to the purpoſe; For all we convince now, is, That Faith (if any be in the World) muſt finally Reſt on Gods infallible Revelation, and conſequently, That no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Moral certainty hath Strength enough to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it. Now by what means it comes at laſt, to be ſetled in this Center of Gods infallible Veracity, is another queſtion; Thus it muſt Reſt, or, as our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries confes, <hi>looſe the Eſſence of infallible Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Briefly. We ſhall now make good the other Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion in the Title, and ſhow, Though Moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102687:48"/> were (as it is not) a prop ſtrong enough to<note place="margin">Proteſtants Religion hath not Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</note> ſupport Chriſtian Religion, yet Proteſtants have no Degree of it for their Pretended Religion. I prove this Truth. By Proteſtancy, we muſt either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe Prudential Motives, which induce men to Believe the <hi>Specifical</hi> and particular Doctrins of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants (ſuch are <hi>Miracles, Antiquity,</hi> great <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions &amp;c.</hi>) Or rather the very Tenents and Doctrins actually believed by them. For example: <hi>That all Paſtors may err in delivering Christian Doctrin. That there are two Sacraments only,</hi> or, what elſe you will. If we ſpeak of Motives, this Religion is ſo naked, that it cannot ſhew you ſo much as one, as is largely De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in the 8. 9. and 10. enſuing Chapters, whether to avoyd an unneceſſary Repetition, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is remitted. Waving therfore at preſent a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proof hereof, I Argue thus againſt the <hi>Moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proteſtants Doctrin. without Rational induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> of their Doctrin. A Doctrin broached without Previous rational Inducements, (whoſe very Profeſſors were and are no more but Fallible) and which at its firſt Riſe, or Appearance in the World ſeemed a meer Paradox to the far greater part of Chriſtians, and yet throughly examined, is held ſtill by this far greater number (moſt knowing and learned) falſe, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, cannot be a Doctrin morally certain. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy is thus conſeſtedly fallible, and both at its<note place="margin">A Conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
                  <hi>Riſe</hi> was, and is Still Oppoſed, not only by the vaſt number of Catholicks, But by all other Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks alſo, as <hi>fals</hi> and <hi>improbable; Ergo,</hi> it is not a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin Morally Certain.</hi> That a Doctrin ſo meanly thought of and univerſally Decryed, cannot be thus Certain, is proved out of the very <hi>Notion</hi> of Moral
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102687:48"/> certainty, which though not abſolutely infallible, yet, when the Grounds and Motives of it are perfectly known, it paſſeth for an <hi>uncontradicted Truth,</hi> and free's men from Doubt, <hi>destructive</hi> of ſuch a degree of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. Thus we ſay morally. <hi>Rome and Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople are now Citties in being. All the inhabitants of China are not dead.</hi> Theſe, And the like Aſſertions paſſe for current Moral Truths, without Oppoſition, without Contradiction. If therfore Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion<note place="margin">The reaſon of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement.</note> were in ſuch a meaſure Morally certain; <hi>That vaſt Multitude of Chriſtians, wherof innumerable are Pious, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious and Learned, could never hold it, as they do, falſe and improbable.</hi> No Verity Morally certain ever mett<note place="margin">A Verity Morally Certain was never ſo long and univerſally oppoſed as Proteſtancy is.</note> with ſuch a ſtrong Contradiction. If ye ſay, This Oppoſition ariſeth out of Malice, ye ſpeak not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and more juſtly draw on your ſelves the like Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for beginning ſo <hi>ſtrange</hi> a Religion. If you ſay again. Theſe Learned Men penetrate not too well the Depth of this new Doctrin, you talk at random. Their Knowledge is not inferiour to Yours; what you ſe, they ſe, and perhaps more. Charge not therfore Ignorance on them, wherof your ſelves are more likely guilty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet ſome Replyes may be here expected. One is. Proteſtants have moral Aſſurance of their Bible, Becauſe all ſay it is Gods Word; <hi>Ergo</hi> they have Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance<note place="margin">Moral Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the Bible is no Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> of their Religion alſo. The Antecedent is bad, and the Conſequence worſe. <hi>Arians, Pelagians,</hi> and all Haereticks are as morally aſſured of their Bible, as any Proteſtant. Have they, I pray you, as great Certainty of thoſe peſtilent Haereſies proved, as they think, out of the Bible? You ſay no, Becauſe they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102687:49"/> Interpret amis, and you do not. Learnedly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. But who makes your Interpretation better then Theirs? They have that Book, and ſpend their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Judgement on it; you have no more. Unles ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your <hi>Book</hi> or Judgement be better then Theirs, You are Altogether as uncertain of your particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins, as They of Theirs. The Reaſon is: Becauſe<note place="margin">Proteſtant Gloſſes no more Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture then the Gloſſes of Arians.</note> you have not one Sole Expres Text of Scripture for Proteſtancy. You may add your own Gloſſes, and make it ſpeak Proteſtancy; But theſe Gloſſes are no more <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor more morally certain, then Thoſe of <hi>Arians, Pelagians</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therfore a moral Aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the Bible which is eaſily abuſed, gives no man mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral certainty of ſound Doctrin. But of this ſubject he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reafter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. A ſecond Objection. As what is Fals, may be by errour judged Morally certain, ſo often what is True, may not be held <hi>Morally</hi> certain. Therfore though Proteſtancy want's that High Moral certainty now required, yet it may be True. I anſwer. But if it want Moral certainty, it <hi>hath it not,</hi> which is all we prove at preſent. Again. Though it may be true (which is impoſſible) ſo alſo it may be fals. Now Proteſtants, I hope, do not believe a meer <hi>Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sectaries can not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the actual Truth of Proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> only, nor the <hi>May be</hi> of Truth (for many Things are not which may be) but they Believe more, the <hi>Actual</hi> ſuppoſed Truth of Proteſtancy. And this they cannot do without Moral Certainty of that which they hold Actually true.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A third Objection, and, 'Tis more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Our Argument now propoſed proves too much, and Therfore proves nothing, For its beſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102687:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> lyes in this one Aſſertion, <hi>viz. That a Doctrin or Religion, which is Oppoſed by the greateſt part of Chriſtians,</hi> as Falſe and Paradoxal, <hi>cannot be Morally certain.</hi> If this Principle hold good, it if followes, That much, and very much too, of the Roman Catholick Doctrin, want's alſo moral Certainty, Becauſe a very great number of Chriſtians oppugne it as fals. Some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the <hi>Popes Supremacy,</hi> Others the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> Others <hi>Purgatory,</hi> Others <hi>Praging for the Dead</hi> &amp;c. And Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, after their long ſtudy, deny all Theſe at on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; Therfore ſuch Doctrins cannot be Morally certain.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I anſwer firſt. This Objection, without doubt, Proves too much and impugn's a Certain Truth of Chriſtianity. For tell me, when the whole world, as <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Hierom</hi> ſaith, growning under Arianiſm, ſaw that Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy far and neer diffuſed: Did that Oppoſition wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Moral certainty which Orthodox Chriſtians had then of a Trinity of Perſons in one Eſſence? (And we only ſpeak now of Moral Evidence Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent<note place="margin">Ancient Motives never looſe their Force.</note> to Faith.) If ſo, the Motives morally evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for the Belief of that Myſtery ceaſed, or, at leaſt loſt their <hi>Ancient Vigor,</hi> which is fals. And one great Realon is; Becauſe that true Doctrin of a Trinity had no <hi>firſt Riſe,</hi> nor appeared like a new Paradox in<note place="margin">Catholick Doctrin had no firſt Riſe like Proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> the world as <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> did, peeping out like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Stranger, when <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> firſt broach'd it. No, That Catholick Doctrin was univerſally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by all faithful Chriſtians, before <hi>Arians</hi> were born. The Motives therfore, which made it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently Credible before <hi>Arius,</hi> continued firm (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding His Oppoſition) and ſtill induced Chriſtians to Believe as They had done formerly. Which Reaſon
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102687:50"/> alſo holds good to our preſent purpoſe, And doth not only give an immenſe Diſparity between the Moral evident Certainty of Catholick Religion, And what ever Certainty Haereſy can Pretend to; But alſo, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively makes both Proteſtancy and all Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy improbable. And this Truth I ſhall evidence, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt cleared the Fallacy which intricates the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply now in hand.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſay therfore. The moſt eaſy way to find out true Religion, or the firſt unqueſtionable Evidence<note place="margin">The way to find out True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is eaſy and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> which points it out, lyes open, and is obvious to All, Before we either examin particular Myſteries of Faith, or enter upon Proofs, Drawn from Scripture, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, or Fathers.

One So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Chriſtians There is, wherin my Eternal Truths are Taught, this I make manifest by evident Signes, by the Light of clear and undeniable Motives, wherof none can, but moſt unreaſonably, doubt.</hi> So it is, ſaith <hi>Origen Hom. 30. in Matth. Eccleſia plena eſt fulgore ab Oriente uſque ad Occiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. The Church, like a Reſplendent Sun, casteth out Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre from Eaſt to Weſt;</hi> and They are blind, who ſee not ſo clear a Brightnes. Thus much premiſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I Anſwer to the Objection above, and ſay.<note place="margin">Sectaries groundles impugning Catholick Doctrin.</note> 
                  <hi>Though thouſands more then Sectaries impugne part of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Doctrin, yet as long as God demonstratively Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth the abſolute Credibility of that Church which teaches it, By ſuch rational prudent, and preſſing Motives, as have gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Millions of Soules to Believe, our Adverſaries in banding againſt Church Doctrin, only bewray Malice, Ignorance, or Both, And do no more but caſt dirt at a Sun, which provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> (maugre Their weak Attempts) <hi>will have to Shine, whilſt Chriſtianity laſteth.</hi> So Urgent therfore, ſo Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious are theſe Motives (as I ſhal preſently declare) for the total Belief of what the Roman Catholick Church teaches, <hi>That they do not only ſuppreſſe and ſilence ſuch weak Opponents, But alſo make Proteſtancy, and all other Sects improbable, and incredible.</hi> The reaſon hereof (moſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102687:51"/> amply laid forth in the three next following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) ſtand's ſure on theſe two undeniable Principles. Firſt; That Church which <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> founded, (and<note place="margin">Chriſt <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to All, and ſo is his Church.</hi>
                  </note> his Bleſſed Intention was to gain the whole World to it) is ſo <hi>Eminently Glorious,</hi> ſo Clearly <hi>Marked</hi> with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boubted Signs and moſt <hi>Legible Characters</hi> of Truth, That the Simpleſt Man, if he follow Reaſon, may find it out, and Believe ſecurely.

               <p n="4">4. You will ſay. Notwithſtanding all the glorious Marks we can lay claim to, and grace our Church withal, very many Learned Men do oppoſe it. If then the Argument above have force This very Oppoſition of ſo many, <hi>Weaken's</hi> much, and takes of no few De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of that Moral certainty we ſtand for. <hi>Contra.</hi> Very many Learned men oppoſed both Apoſtolical and<note place="margin">Slight Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition not Valued of.</note> Primitive Doctrin, Atheiſts band againſt God, and Iewes againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Arians yet impugn a Trinity.

The Oppoſition then in our preſent Matter (if to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)<note place="margin">It ought to be deeply rational and brought to certain Principles.</note> ought to be well Grounded and <hi>deeply Rational; grounded,</hi> I ſay, not upon what, This or That priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te perſon by his ſole fallible boſom Thoughts, holds Reaſonable (for ſo every Arian will make good his Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy) But the Oppoſition if <hi>rational</hi> muſt go further, and reſt at laſt upon a Solid and <hi>ſatisfactory Principle,</hi> which well laid forth, gently forceth every Prudent<note place="margin">Sectaries deſtitute of any Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Proof againſt the Catholick Church.</note> and Diſintereſſed Man to Acquieſce and yeild to it. But this cannot be done in our preſent caſe; for Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are ſo utterly deſtitute of what ever look's like a Rational Proof or any received Principle, They are ſo diſinabled to ſpeak <hi>with ſenſe</hi> againſt the known Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Roman Catholick Religion, That (And I do aſſert it boldly) <hi>They shall as ſoon turn Chriſtianity out of the World, as rationally abate or leſſen the plain and undiſputable Evidence of this one Chriſtian Society.</hi>
               </p>

This <hi>bleſſed Society</hi> therfore, ſtands thus upon firm<note place="margin">Solid Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</note> Ground, upon ſolid and undoubted Principles. I ſhew you, <hi>ſaith this Church,</hi> Thoſe very Motives, which anciently countenanced the Preaching of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and converted the world, And Theſe plead for me. With what urgent contrary Proofs can you, my good Proteſtants, deface ſuch Glorious Marks of Truth, or make them either Inſignificant, or forceles Arguments? Is this weightily done by drawing a few trivial Gloſſes<note place="margin">Sectaries trifle.</note> out of miſtaken Scripture? By telling us of Council contradicting Council, By quoting our Authors wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, By relating a ſtory not worth the hearing of <hi>a Pope, or Prelate?</hi> Are theſe Manly proofs, think ye,

This <hi>Nubes teſtium</hi> alone, and of <hi>ſuch witneſſes</hi> (which is ever to be reflected on) makes it <hi>evidently Credible.</hi> And by what contrary <hi>rational</hi> Proof or <hi>received Principle,</hi> can our Adverſaries enervate, or make <hi>null</hi> the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony<note place="margin">All Theſe wiſe and Learned cannot be ſuppoſed mad, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Fooleries.</note> of theſe innumerable <hi>Givers in of Evidence,</hi> who led on by Motives, which They thought Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal (and what paſſed for Reaſon amongſt ſo many and ſuch <hi>qualified Perſons,</hi> ought to paſſe for Reaſon with all) Believed this Church and dyed in it happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102687:53"/> He therfore, who, when rational Proofs fail, cannot<note place="margin">If Sectaries ſlight ſuch witneſſes, They ſlight themſelves much more.</note> ſpeak a reaſonable word againſt theſe Millions of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, But ſlights and undervalues them; doth not only ſlight the greateſt Authority on Earth, But alſo, <hi>if he be a Proteſtant, muſt ſlight Proteſtancy; if an Arian, Arianiſm.

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. For concluſion of this matter, be pleaſed to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, That as our Adverſaries are deſtitute of rational Proofs (reducible to <hi>received Principles</hi>) whilſt They im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the clear Evidence of our Church, ſo they alſo want them in all other particular Controverſies. For, whether They go about to oppoſe our Doctrin,<note place="margin">Soctaries never come to Princi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ples.</note> or to prove their own, You can never draw from them Proof brought to an <hi>undoubted Principle,</hi> as I ſhall moſt amply ſhow hereafter. They are Opponents ('Tis true) when they tell us we have changed the Ancient Doctrin of the Church, brought in novelties, and I know not what. We hear ſuch Talk, but where is the <hi>Propoſitio quieſcens,</hi> or grounded Proof to make this Charge good? <hi>They ſay ſo,</hi> And that is all. And yet, if poſſible, They are worſe at it, in proving Their own Doctrin. Take here one Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, you ſhall have more hereafter. We demand<note place="margin">A question propoſed.</note> upon what rational Proof can Theſe men Believe the Sacred Myſtery of the <hi>Bleſſed Trinity,</hi> and deny the Catholick Doctrin of <hi>Chriſts Real Preſence</hi> in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Are they forced to Admit of the one, and<note place="margin">Proteſtants believe one Mystery, reject an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other with out proof.</note> Reject the other by clear and manifeſt Scripture? Evidently no. Scripture is without controverſy, more openly Significant, and Expreſſive for the Real Preſence, then for a <hi>Trinity.</hi> Doth the Difficulty
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102687:53"/> of the Sacrament rationally retard their Belief? The <hi>Trinity</hi> is yet a more difficil Myſtery to Reaſon. O, but the <hi>Trinity</hi> was ever Believed by the True Church: So, ſay I, was The other Myſtery alſo. But ſpeak Reaſon now, And ſay, what Church was it which ever believed the <hi>Trinity?</hi> The Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church ſurely, For <hi>Arius</hi> and others impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned that Myſtery. Now Proteſtants ſay this Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Church erred in believing <hi>Chriſts Real Preſence;</hi> and if ſo, They are moſt unreaſonable in relying on it for the Belief of a <hi>Trinity;</hi> For, if it erred in the Belief of one Myſtery, it may as well have erred in the other. They may ſay, the beſt and moſt Ancient Fathers held a <hi>Trinity.</hi> Very true; And as evidently They believed <hi>Christs</hi> Real Preſence in the Euchariſt. But what will you ſay, if I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the Authority of theſe learned Father in this matter? I can do it (though not in Real Truth) moſt eaſily, being aſſiſted by the Principles of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, who tell us, that the <hi>whole Roman Church,</hi> That is, All the Fathers and Doctors of it, erred for a thouſand years together in believing the Catholick<note place="margin">If the Church had erred, the Fathers may more likely have erred.</note> Doctrin of the Bleſſed Sacrament. Wherupon I inferre Thoſe Ancient Fathers, who both learnedly defended, and piouſly believed a <hi>Myſterious Trinity,</hi> may more likely have erred in doing ſo, then, that <hi>a whole Church,</hi> for ſo vaſt a Time, hath patroniſed erroneous Doctrin, and falſly believed the Real Preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. Moſt undoubtedly, <hi>The wiſdom and Authority of this long ſtandingh Catholick Church, is, in true Prudence, of greater ſway</hi> and value, then the ſole Authority of thoſe far fewer Ancient Fathers can be (though moſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102687:54"/> Venerable, and worthy all Reſpect) that writ of the<note place="margin">Sectaries who ſlight a whole learned Church may more rationally ſlight the Ancient Fathers.</note> 
                  <hi>Sacred Trinity.</hi> Thoſe men therfore, who have the Boldnes to ſlight ſo great a Church, cannot wtih ſo much as a colour of Reaſon Reverence more highly thoſe Ancient Fathers. But enough of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Let us now go on to a further conſideration of theſe prudent Motives, and ſe more particularly, what Religion gives us the beſt Evidence of Them.</p>

               <head type="sub">A few Reflections made upon theſe Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves of credibility. No Religion hath Motives founding moral certainty but One only, which is the Roman Catholick Religion.</head>
               <p n="1">1. NOte firſt. If God (as we now ſuppoſe) gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des<note place="margin">All Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians prr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe not Christs true Do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctrin.</note> us by his Providence, and hath eſtabliſhed true Religion in the world, it is as certain, that all who profes Chriſtianity (for example <hi>Arians,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians</hi>) believe not intierly <hi>Chriſts</hi> true Doctrin, as that ſome, bleſſed by ſo ſingular a Favour, both rightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and profes it. It is again moſt certain, That<note place="margin">How God lead's us to the knowledge of true Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion.</note> if this wiſe Providence draws us not to the knouwledge of true Religion by <hi>Euthuſias'ms, private Illustration,</hi> or the <hi>miniſtery of Angels;</hi> it leads us on by extrinſecal Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102687:54"/> ſuitable to Reaſon, by rational Inducements, or diſcernable Evidence: And, theſe we call known <hi>Signs, Cogniſances of Truth, evident Marks, clear Characters, or plain ſpeaking Language, which plead as it were in Gods behalf, and as clearly shew us where true Religion is, as Theſe viſible Creatures manifeſt a Deity, or, as that Star which brought the Sages to Bethlem, pointed out the Saviour of the world.</hi> None can Deny Theſe plain Inducements of Faith; But ſuch as deny thoſe <hi>firſt and moſt clear Manifestations of Truth,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord and his Bleſſed Apoſtles evidenced, when by Their <hi>admirable Miracles, ſtrange Converſions, Sanctity of life &amp;c. They withdrew beguiled Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les from Error, and wrought Faith in Them, Before one Word of Scripture was regiſtred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Note 2. (And it is the Reflection of a learned Author.) As no man enters on a Diſpute with others,<note place="margin">God, as it were, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood with rational Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> but be hopes to get the better; ſo God, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth true Religion to Chriſtians, engageth as it we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in a Diſpute with the Devil, and all thoſe Sectaries who oppoſe it, And therfore <hi>cannot hope,</hi> But <hi>is ſure</hi> to conquer and convince his Adverſaries; otherwiſe it were folly to begin a Diſpute; which would not end to his Honor.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Note 3. It is impoſſible (after the Eſtabliſhment of true Faith amongſt Chriſtians) <hi>That God, either will or can permit a falſe Religion to be more Speciouſly evident to Reaſon by Force of rational Motives, then his true Religion
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102687:55"/> is.</hi> For were this poſſible, He would oblige Reaſon<note place="margin">A falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Speciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident to reaſon, then Gods true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is,</note> by rational Inducements to embrace a fals Religion, which is highly repugnant to his Goodnes. And, upon this ground I ſay more. It is impoſſible, <hi>That a falſe Religion equalize the true One, in the Evidence of ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Motives; For, if the evidences for Falshood be equal with thoſe other of Truth, God would ſtand guilty of arguing leſs efficaciouſly,</hi> in behalf of his own Verities. We<note place="margin">Nor can equalize it in the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Credibility.</note> muſt then conclude, That Gods true Religion, ever, moſt eminently ſurpaſſeth falſhood in the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>luſtre</hi> of thoſe Motives which evidence it to Reaſon. And from hence it followes, <hi>That no man can in Iuſtice appropriate thoſe rational Inducements, which draw reaſon to</hi>

                  <hi>find out true Religion, to all, who go under the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi> For amongſt theſe (whether <hi>Arians</hi> or others) you have falſe Religions; but the <hi>Marks, Motives</hi> and <hi>Cogniſances</hi> of Truth cannot belong to a falſe Religion, unles God propoſe error as Speciouſly evident to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as his own Revealed Truth, which is now <hi>proved impoſſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe few Reflections premiſed. Let us look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout<note place="margin">Two Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions in Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> us, and caſt a ſerious Thoughr on two Religions only, which as it ſeem's, ſtand juſtling with one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, yea, and will needs come into Competition for Truth. The one is, the Ancient and long Continued Roman Catholick Religion. The other, is that <hi>late Novelty</hi> of <hi>Protestaniſm.</hi> Let reaſon, I ſay, go here impartially to work, let it make a diligent enquiry after the Rational Motives, which, as it were, plead in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of theſe two different Religions. Both are not<note place="margin">Both can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be True both have not the like Evidence.</note> true, and Therfore both cannot be evidenced by the like <hi>Marks</hi> ande <hi>Cogniſances</hi> of Truth, the One muſt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102687:55"/> yeild to the Other. What do I ſay yeild? The firſt appears like a glorious Sun <hi>Procedens &amp; creſcens uſque ad perfectum diem,</hi> which, as <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, caſteth ſuch luſtre from Eaſt to Weſt, that all eyes Behold it. The other of Proteſtancy, <hi>Reaſon finds ſo nakedly Poor, ſo deſtitute of Light, and Motives, That its mean Appearance makes it deſpicable,</hi> and not worth the looking at.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Briefly then I Argue for the moral Evidence of our Catholick Roman Religion. A Religion, which, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the juſt Condemnation of ſo many undoubted and acknowledged Haereticks, hath <hi>permanently ſtood Viſibly victorious for 16. hundred years,</hi> And which never yet was<note place="margin">Moral Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the Roman Catholick Religion.</note> condemned by any <hi>known true Church</hi> of Error or Haereſy. <hi>A Religion, which hath drawn thouſands of Infidels, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens</hi> (from <hi>Chriſt) to its Belief. And which hath had Age after Age, whole millions of conſtant Profeſſors, wherof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable were not only moſt Wiſe, Learned and Vertuous, But willingly alſo loſt their temporal Fortunes, and couragiouſly shed their Blood for it.</hi> Such a Religion, I ſay, which hath<note place="margin">It hath gained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Believers.</note> thus perſwaſively wrought on the Reaſon of ſo many Wiſe, and Learned &amp;c. And, gained to it whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of <hi>Believers,</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> ſhewes by this one <hi>admirable Effect</hi> (had we no other Proof) Strength and Evidence enough to convince the moſt obdurate Hart in the World. For, either (as I noted above) we muſt ſay, That all theſe Wiſe and Glorious Men were mad, as being induced by Fooleries to Believe, and dye as they did; or grant, That They had clear and undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Evidence to warrant their Belief, for which we now plead. Nay, I ſay more: So general a Miſtake and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion,<note place="margin">Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence over his Church could not permit ſo general a Deluſion.</note> is upon an other Account moſt impoſſible; <hi>For, that great Care and Providence which God had ever of his Church,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102687:56"/> could not permit</hi> (if true Faith were in the world from the fifth Age to <hi>Luther) ſo learned, ſo numerous, and pretious a part of Chriſtians as Roman Catholicks were in thoſe Dayes, to be led into a falſs Belief by either trivial or foolish Motives.</hi> If we ſwallow down this <hi>vaſt impoſſibility,</hi> we muſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,<note place="margin">Note wel, a vaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility.</note> that, for ſo long a time, God had no true Church at all; For none, called Chriſtians, were then in being But <hi>Catholicks only, and known condemned Haereticks.</hi> But of this particular moſt largely Hereafter. In the interim</p>
               <p n="6">6. I propoſe a ſecond and moſt convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>No Religion</hi> Ex termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently true or falſe.</hi>
                  </note> No Religion, whether it be that of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that of Catholicks, or Sectaries, either is, or can be <hi>ex Terminis evidently True or Falſe;</hi> neither can a bare <hi>Affirmation for its Truth, without farther Proof, force</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Catholick Religion.</note> 
                  <hi>Reaſon to accept of it:</hi> Otherwiſe, every man might now begin a new Religion as he liſt's, and ſufficiently war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it by only ſaying, He <hi>ſpeaks Truth.</hi> True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion therfore muſt have its Evidence, and known <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcernibility</hi> from Error, before it be accepted of. And now, becauſe both Catholicks and all Sectaries ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the Religion, which <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> and his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtles taught, was indubitably and clearly <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced by Marks,</hi> and <hi>convincing Signs of Truth.</hi> We are in the firſt place to ponder well thoſe Motives, which made evident that firſt Chriſtian and Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Doctrin; and next to Conſider, whether the very <hi>like Motives</hi> have not evidenced the Roman <hi>Catholick Faith</hi> Age after Age. Briefly. The greateſt and moſt viſible Evidences for that Apoſtolical Doctrin, were (to omit others) <hi>firſt, moſt known and unqueſtioned Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> (The <hi>Dead roſe up to Life,</hi> the <hi>Blind ſaw,</hi> the <hi>Deaf</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:102687:56"/> heard, <hi>Devils were ejected out of poſſeſſed Perſons &amp;c.) 2. Admirable Converſions wrought upon Infidels and Gentils. 3. An examplar Neglect of the World, conjoyned with great Sanctity of life &amp;c.</hi> But theſe Evidences are clear,<note place="margin">Apoſtolical Evidences of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions &amp;c. are the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> without diſpute for the Doctrin of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, and for no other Religion. Therfore if thoſe primitive <hi>Miracles, that Efficacy of Doctrin,</hi> thoſe great <hi>Converſions, that admirable Sanctity of the firſt Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Men,</hi> perſwaſively induced Aliens from Truth, to believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> They are yet, as powerful and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable to induce All, who follow Reaſon, to Believe both <hi>the Antecedent Church of Rome, and this modern Church alſo, now in Being.</hi> No tolerable Reply can be given to this Argument. Will our new Men deny emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Sanctity to innumerable, who profeſs our Roman Religion? The contrary is evident, by all thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent<note place="margin">Evidence of Sanctity.</note> Signs, wherby Sanctity can be known in this mortal Life. <hi>Witnes the Contempt of the World manifeſt in Thouſands, the charitable Alms deeds of Seculars, the Auſtere and mortified Life of Religious,</hi> wherof more Herafter &amp;c. O, but all Paſtors and Doctors of the Catholick Church are not Saints like the Apoſtles. <hi>Frivolous.</hi> No more were all the Primitive Paſtors or People for 4. or 5. Ages after <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo <hi>Eminently</hi> Holy, (do out Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants arrive to that Degree of Sanctity?) <hi>Yet thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands then were, and are ſtill without debate, Innocent, Holy and Virtuous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Again. Can Sectaries deny thoſe prodigious Converſions of Nations, wrought by this Church upon Heathens and Aliens from <hi>Chriſt?</hi> If they do, All are upon Record, both Friends and Enemies attribute theſe Wonders to that <hi>Mother Church.</hi> Tell me, I
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102687:57"/> beſeech you, who converted <hi>our once</hi> moſt <hi>Catholick</hi>

                  <hi>England</hi> to the Faith it Anciently had, but Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks?

If Finally they doubt of our Miracles, They may as well doubt of the Suns light at noon Day, ſo Conſpicuous They have been ever in this Church, and are ſtill to this preſent Age. Wherof more in the next Chapter. All I ask now is, Whether it be not morally certain, that the World had once in it ſuch Men as were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Alexander, Caeſar, Pompey, Cicero?</hi> yes.

The Argument is convincing, and proves as well, that thoſe after Converſions wrought upon Infidels by Roman Evangelical Preachers, were Admirable, and truely <hi>Miraculous.</hi> Millions have been converted by them. Theſe numerous multitudes therfore of Believers were either drawn on by fooleries. If ſo;<note place="margin">Fooleries could not induce Millions to contemn the world and beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me good Chriſtians.</note> They were mad, And <hi>here lyes the Miracles, ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.

If ſo; <hi>Why are not our Proteſtants obliged to believe as they did, upon the ſame prudent Inducements.</hi> If They Tell us: The Church Taught an other Doctrin, when theſe great Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were made, then it Teaches now; They do not only moſt unlearnedly Suppoſe what is to be Proved (yea cannot be proved becauſe utterly falſe) But alſo ſpeak not one Word to the Purpoſe; For, both our Progenitors in England and innumerable others, were drawn from Error by Popiſh Preachers. And even in this preſent Age, the like glorious Converſions are, and have been wrought by theſe Bleſſed mens Labours,<note place="margin">Why theſe Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</note> and Theirs <hi>only.</hi> Now if you ask upon what Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſuch Converſions are to be eſteemed Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous?

Would you not ſay, that ſuch a work were prodigious, and above the force of nature? This is our very caſe. Behold ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Luc. 10. I ſend you as Lambs amongſt Wolves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe you muſt ſubdue. It was done. Behold, ſaith the Roman Catholick Church, I ſend my Preachers ſtill abroad to the Remoteſt parts of the World, and have changed Wolves into Lambs, That is, I have made Infidels, once Rebellious to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Subject to his lawes, the Vitious I have made Virtuous, and brought thouſands of them to no other Religion, but Popery. This work, with the Aſſiſtance of Gods Grace is done, <hi>Et eſt mirabile in oculis noſtris,</hi> and 'tis admirable. Had our Proteſtants made ſuch Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or drawn ſo many Infidels to their new Faith, they would have talked of wonders; But becauſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks<note place="margin">Why Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants flight Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions?</note> gained them to the old Religion, all is No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. So it is. <hi>They have no Miracles, and therfore Slight them: No Converſions, and therſore undervalue them.</hi> A Strange proceeding. <hi>Thoſe very wonders which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the world to become Chriſtian, Becauſe they yet emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently appear in the Roman Catholick Church,</hi> muſt ly under Contempt; Thoſe Ancient Proofs of Chriſtianity are now proofles, Thoſe Primitive Evidences of <hi>Miracles, Converſions &amp;c.</hi> (the Church is in fault for ſhewing them) cannot be ſeen by theſe later Men, who yet have Eyes to diſcern the Book of Scripture by its own Light and Majeſty. And by the way mark the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102687:58"/> Paradox. The exteriour <hi>words</hi> of a Bible (for of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<note place="margin">A Paradox of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> we only ſpeak) are Evidences enough for Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re; yet thoſe glorious <hi>works</hi> now mentioned are (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) no Evidence of this Church. <hi>The very Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of the style</hi> Aſcertain's theſe men, that God Speak's by that Sacred Book; yet all the <hi>perceptible miraculous Majeſty,</hi> which the Church ſhewes us, cannot perſwade them, that he ſpeaks by this <hi>viſible, audible,</hi> and moſt known <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>Truth.</hi> A Bible (well known, its true, upon other Grounds to be moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred) diſcouers its Divinity, and immediatly proves who writ it, <hi>Yet a Church ſo gloriouſly marked, ſayes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing who Directs it.</hi> Is this Reaſon, or Religion think ye? Can Reaſon produce this unreaſonable Thought in any, That the wiſe Providence of God hath permitted ſo eminent, ſo numerous, ſo pious, ſo learned, and ſo long ſtanding a Multitude of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as Catholicks have been (and yet are) to be Cheated into Errour, even whilſt they evidence their Faith, by ſuch Proofs and Motives, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles manifeſted Chriſtian Religion? What?

               <p n="8">8. Other Arguments we have for a greater Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then moral, <hi>previouſly</hi> Evidencing the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

Whilſt They talk of no man knowes what Evidence manifeſting Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in General, They only plead for our Catholick Faith, and ſpeak not a word in behalf of Proteſtancy.

               <head type="sub">A ſhort Digreſsion concerning the Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling of Proteſtants in this matter.</head>
               <p n="1">1.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102687:59"/> handle it ſo unluckily, that no man Hear's a word more ſpoken in behalf of Proteſtaniſm, then of Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, or of what ever other Haereſy. Motives and Reaſons they give none for Proteſtant Doctrin, <hi>as Protestancy,</hi> As They ought to have done in the firſt place, after ſo glorious a Title.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To prove what is ſaid, have patience to hear ſome few parergons. <hi>There are,</hi> ſay They, <hi>in the queſtion of reſolving Faith theſe three queſtions to be reſolved.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Why I believe thoſe things to be true, which are contained in the Book called Scripture? 2. Why I believe the Doctrin contained in that Book to be Divine? 3. Why I believe the Books themſelves to be of Divine Revelation?</hi> Mark here a Shufling, and remember once more the Title. <hi>The Proteſtants way of reſolving Faith.</hi> Is it ſo? Is it the Proteſtants way? Yes. Surely then the Queſtions here propoſed, and the Anſwers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned are moſt Pertinent to help on Proteſtants in their reſolving Faith, That is, to make Proteſtancy<note place="margin">Theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors wave what they ſhould Explicate.</note> 
                  <hi>evidently credible</hi> by clear and rational Motives. You will ſay, They are ſo. And I ſay, They are no more to that purpoſe (of Proteſtants reſolving Faith, or giving of prudent Motives for Proteſtancy) then if ſuch a Religion had never been in the world. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve my Aſſertion. The <hi>Arian</hi> will ſay. <hi>I believe</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Arians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as much as Proteſtants</note> 
                  <hi>thoſe Things to be True which are contained in Scripture. I believe the Doctrin in that Book, to be Divine. I believe the Books themſelves to be of Divine Revelation,</hi> and this I do upon as good Grounds, as you Proteſtants, if not on better. For if you admit of theſe Verities, upon the greateſt Evidence, which things of that Nature are capable of, So do I too. But ſay, I beſeech
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102687:60"/> you, what more Advantage have you upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, for your <hi>particular Religion,</hi> then I have for <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne?</hi> For, let theſe Books be <hi>True,</hi> let them contain <hi>Divine Doctrin,</hi> let us believe the Revelation in them to be Sacred, yet both you and I are to ſeek which of us hath the better Religion, and this cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by owing <hi>three Truths,</hi> wherof no Chriſtian ever doubted. Why therfore do you, when it is your particular Task to reſolve <hi>Protestants Faith,</hi> never meddle with the Queſtion? But waſt time in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that, which when it is proved, help's you no more then all other Chriſtians, who are contrary to you in Belief. Will you ſe this clearly?</p>
               <p n="3">3. I freely grant, that thoſe things in Scripture are True, They are Divine, the Books themſelves are of <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> But next ask, What is this to Proteſtant Religion? Or, how, is the Reſolution of Proteſtants Faith advanced upon the owning <hi>Theſe Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities?</hi> Nothing at all. And the Reaſon is, for rhough all Chriſtians acknowledge in general Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to be moſt Divine, yet they are at endles Diſputes concerning the Doctrin of it. <hi>Now, no Man, I hope,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To have Scripture in our hands gives no Aſſurance of true Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>will ſay, Becauſe he hath this Book in his hands, or owns it as Gods Word, that therfore He rightly Believes the particular neceſſary Doctrin in it.</hi> For, were this true, known Haeretiks would be as ſound in Faith as any. To conclude then, The Roman Catholick enquires not here after any <hi>general Proof</hi> of Scripture (He proved that before Proteſtants were born) But he urges for <hi>Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of Proteſtants.</note> and rational <hi>Inducements,</hi> wherby Proteſtancy, <hi>as Proteſtancy,</hi> is evidenced to have any reſſemblance with the Primitive Doctrin of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his bleſſed Apoſtles.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102687:60"/> Known Marks and Cogniſances of Truth, muſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt this <hi>particular Doctrin, And not a general talk of the Divinity of Scripture, which every Arian and Haeretick would own,</hi> were <hi>there no ſuch thing as a Proteſtant in Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They hold on in this proofles ſtrain, and tell us how Moral certainty is Aſſurance enough, that Chriſtian Religion is infallibly true. Be it ſo, it is nothing to the purpoſe; For we enquire not in this place after the moral Evidence of Chriſtian Religion in General, which, as it profeſſed by <hi>condemned Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proteſtancy uneviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</note> hath none; But we ask for the moral Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherby <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> is evidenced. This is not ſo much as ſpoken of, though the Title of <hi>reſolving Proteſtants Faith</hi> requires a direct Anſwer to this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. They ſay again, <hi>There can be no greater then moral Certainty for the main Foundations of all Religion,</hi> and <hi>the chiefeſt is the Exiſtency and Being of God.</hi> The Aſſertion is falſs, as I could demonſtrate, were it now pertinent to handle that queſtion. But Let it paſs. Give us, I beſeech you, as much Moral certainty of Proteſtant Religion, as All acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge for the Exiſtency of a Deity, and we are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; But of this we hear not a word. We ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve Talk enough of the Moral certainty of Chriſtian<note place="margin">They An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer not to the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> Religion, <hi>which Anſwers not to the Title of reſolving Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. They ſay thirdly. <hi>Suppoſe, God gives the muſt infallible Evidence of any Religion, ſome who are bound to believe that Religion, can have no more then Moral certainty of it. Tranſeat totum,</hi> at preſent. What makes it for Proteſtancy? We here ask, Why Proteſtants believe as they do? Why They adhere to their
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102687:61"/> new Faith, and preferr that Before all other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions? Rational Motives Can be produced, or not. We hitherto hear of none, And therfore ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, yea, know very well, there are none for it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They ſay fourthly. <hi>Moral certainty yeilds us ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proteſtants altogether in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls.</note> 
                  <hi>Aſſurance that Chriſtian Religion is infallibly true.</hi> What Religion is infallibly true upon moral certainty.

Then produce Rational Motives which may ground a moral certainty more of this Religion, then of any other Sect, and we acquieſce. But this you cannot do.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They ſay fifthly. <hi>Where there is evident credibility in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And prove nothing for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> 
                  <hi>the matter propounded, there doth ariſe upon Men an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to believe.</hi> Very good! To believe, what. Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve us this evident Credibility of Proteſtancy, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mething is ſaid to the purpoſe. Hereof yet we have no news, nor are like to have, and conſequently Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants cannot be obliged to Believe as they do. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome other Parergons,</p>
               <p n="8">8. They ſay ſixthly. <hi>The laſt Reſolution of Faith is not into the infallibility of the inſtrument of conveyance, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the infallibility of that Doctrin which is therby conveyed to us.</hi> Shall we eternally have theſe Empty words, and no Subſtance? You talk here of an infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Doctrin, and we would have the Riddle expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Is it the Roman Catholick Doctrin? Or yours? Or <hi>Arianiſm?</hi> What for Gods ſake, avail's it to hear a noiſe of infallible Doctrin, and not to know, who rightly profeſſeth it? Your Doctrin therfore of Proteſtancy is to be Evidenced, this is all we look for.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:102687:61"/>9. They ſay ſeventhly. <hi>If the Doctrin of Chriſt be true and Divine, then all the promiſes made were accomplished: Now that was one of the greatest, that his Spirit should lead his Apoſtles into all Truth.</hi> Very true. But what is this for Proteſtant Doctrin? We ask ſtill by what Signs and Marks of Truth, do theſe new Men prove their particular Faith to be Apoſtolical? Here only lyes the Difficulty, never touched on by them. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit therfore at preſent, that they have in their hands the infallible Records of Gods Word, they are far of yet from proving their particular Doctrin of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy to be Scripture, or the infallible Word of God. This is the ſole controverted Queſtion between us.</p>
               <p n="10">10. They finally end. <hi>Thus much may ſuffiſe in general concerning the Proteſtant way of reſolving Faith.</hi> Very little, it ſeems, ſerves their turn, who hitherto never<note place="margin">Loct labour to talk of Chriſtian Religion in General.</note> medled with that Reſolution; But have loſt their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, by a talking in <hi>General</hi> of Chriſtian Religion, which no more concern's Proteſtancy, then it doth the worſt of Haereticks. And after this manner They hold on in another Chapter entituled. <hi>The ſenſe of Fathers in this Controverſy;</hi> Where <hi>Iuſtin Martyr, Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi>

                  <hi>of Alexandria</hi> are cited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to what purpoſe God only knows. Are they quoted to evidence any thing like Proteſtancy? No. The whole-Diſcours of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Learned Fathers look's another way, and never medles with this Novelty. Read them as they are, either in Theſe Authors (with all the Advantages of their Gloſſes on them) or rather in the Originals, as I have don exactly, you will find them ſo great Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to this new Haereſy; That they never thought of it. To tranſcribe again their whole Diſcours
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102687:62"/> would prove tedious, read <hi>Iuſtins</hi> words in theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors <hi>Part. 1. Chap. 9. page</hi> 264. and add to them the reflection made <hi>page 265. What part</hi> (ſay they) <hi>is there now of our Reſolution of Faith which is not here in</hi> (that is in <hi>Iuſtins</hi> Teſtimony) <hi>aſſerted?</hi> I anſwer, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, as will appear by your own Queſtions and Anſwers wholy irrelative to Proteſtancy. Thus then you go on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If you ask why you believe there were ſuch men in the</hi>

Toyes. No more then are Proteſtants. 3. <hi>If you ask, ſay you, why you Believe them to be true Prophets?</hi> Anſw. <hi>The excellency of their Doctrin joyned with the fulfilling of Prophecies, and working Miracles, abundantly prove it.</hi> Prove what for Gods ſake? No more but this, that thoſe Prophets taught excellent Doctrin, and wrought Miracles; Doth it therfore follow that Proteſtants, Arians, and other Haereticks teach ſuch Doctrin, or work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles? No. Herein lyes the Difficulty, not ſo much as glanced at, or touched on. And thus<note place="margin">Nor Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alex.</note> they run on to no purpoſe for many pages, with Teſtimonies drawn out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus,</hi> which no more relate to Proteſtancy then
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102687:62"/> thoſe firſt Words of <hi>Geneſis</hi> do: <hi>In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth.</hi> Nay more. <hi>Clemens</hi> cited<note place="margin">But Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes them.</note> by theſe Authors, <hi>page</hi> 273. expreſly confutes our Sectaries, whilſt he requires two things neceſſary to attain to the true knowledge of true Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Signs, wherby we diſcover</hi> Chriſt <hi>to be the Son of God, are the Prophecies declaring his coming. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant, were the Testimonies concerning his Birth.

Moſt true and Divine Doctrin, which is entirely for the Roman Catholick Religion, and againſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. Why? We enquire after the precedent Signs, wherby their new Religion is diſcovered? We ask for ſubſequent Signs, which were publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to the world ſoon after the broaching of their new Faith, and yet cannot hear of any ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe new men in confirmation of their Faith. Finally, we urge for Miracles and other Prudential Motives Evidencing Proteſtant Religion in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Chapter (but find none.) Read it, and give an impartial judgement.</p>

               <p n="1">1. WE have ſeen already both the Weaknes and<note place="margin">Two Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches very different.</note> Strength, the Obſcurity and Glory of two different Churches, Proteſtant and Catholick. The firſt pittifully Naked, The other richly Adorned with ſuch <hi>Noble Marks of Truth,</hi> as force Reaſon to give a final Sentence, and ſay, If Religion be in the world, it muſt be found amongſt thoſe Chriſtians who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate it Credible with moſt urgent and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Motives. But this Catholick Religion only doe's, and not Proteſtancy: For Proteſtants (I Aſſert it boldly) have not ſo much as one Rational Motive (much les the <hi>complexum</hi> of all now related) that works upon Prudence, and (Antecedently to their new Faith) makes them Believe as they do. If They have any ſuch, my earneſt petition is to hear of Them, or ſe them clearly layd forth to the Reaſon of other men; or, if They fail in this (as of neceſſity they muſt) let them Speak the plain Truth, <hi>Viz.</hi> That all <hi>They Write and Preach, is lost labor, whilſt they go about to draw Rational men to a Religion, for which there is no Reaſon.</hi> And</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here I anſwer to the trivial Talk of Proteſtants (pretending to follow Reaſon in all they Believe) and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102687:72"/> once more Aſſert. They have nothing like a ſhadow<note place="margin">Protestants have no shadow of Reaſon for their new Religion.</note> of Reaſon <hi>previous to their Faith,</hi> either for their new Religion in <hi>General,</hi> or any particular <hi>Tenent</hi> in it. To prove my Aſſertion, We muſt diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the prudent Inducements that draw one <hi>to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> and the <hi>Elicit Act of Faith it ſelf.</hi> Theſe Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement Precede Faith, and are properly the Object of Diſcours. Faith ſolely relyes on Gods Revealed <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony,</hi> without the mixture of Reaſon for its <hi>Motive,</hi> The Previous motives well pondered, bring with them an Obligation of Believing, and not Faith it ſelf: For no man ſaith. <hi>I am obliged to believe, Becauſe I belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve; But therfore I believe, Becauſe antecedently to my Faith, I find my ſelf obliged upon Prudent Reaſons to believe as I do.</hi> Thus much ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Make a ſearch into all the Motives imaginable, that may Prudently induce a Seeker after Truth, to embrace Proteſtant Religion, you ſhall find nothing propoſed to Reaſon, That hath the Appearance of Reaſon in it. For example. Ask firſt <hi>in General,</hi> upon what Motive <hi>Extrinſecal</hi> to their Faith, do theſe men own Proteſtancy, as the only true and pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? Why dare they ſo boldly prefer it before the Faith of the long ſtanding Catholick Church, yea, or before that of their homebred Sectaries, of <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Independents?</hi> Silence will prove the beſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, They can Shew no Motive at all. Perhaps we may hear them ſay, They reject the Ancient Church becauſe of its Errors, and Novelties. If ſo, They firſt lamentably beg the queſtion, and Suppoſe that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is yet to be Proved. 2. They anſwer not to the Difficulty. For grant (which is utterly fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe)
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102687:73"/> that the Church hath erred, we ask not here for Arguments to Refute thoſe Errors, But inquire after Rational and perſwaſive Motives, wherby Truth is <hi>proved to stand</hi> on the Proteſtant ſide? A poor<note place="margin">A poor Comfort, to learn that my Religion is not good unles Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries prove theirs to be better.</note> Comfort, God know's, it is for me, <hi>To hear from a Proteſtant, that my Religion is not Right, unles upon weighty Reaſons He convince me that his is better.</hi> For, ſay I, <hi>If the old Religion be naught, This new one may be worſe, and more erroneous.</hi> Sectaries are therfore oblig'd to bring in palpable Evidences, wherby their Religion is poſitively demonſtrated <hi>Credible</hi> and only the beſt, which ſhall never be done.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If yet, to anſwer the Difficulty, They take poſt<note place="margin">Recourſe to Scripture clear's not the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</note> to Scripture for Proof of their Religion, They are out of the way, and at the Concluſion before they put the Premiſes. For in this place we make no inquiry after their <hi>formal act</hi> of Faith, nor the immediate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject therof, (we know well their Anſwer) But only<note place="margin">Protestants have no Motives to believe contrary to the Church Or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Quakers.</note> Ask for the Rational Motive (perceptible by all) that preced's Faith, and Prudently obligeth them to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, contrary both to the <hi>Ancient Church</hi> and their own honeſt Quakers; And this (if the Reply be pertinent) muſt be evidenced, Before they talk of a <hi>new Faith</hi> grounded on Scripture. Had the Primitive Chriſtians, when they left of Judaiſm and Belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Chriſt,</hi> been Ask't. Why they received <hi>Christs</hi> Doctrin, and preferred that before their old Religion, They would have anſwered: <hi>The blind ſe, the lame walk, the dead ariſe</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We behold ſtrange Wonders with our eyes, which powerfully work upon Reaſon, and cannot but proceed from God.</hi> When therfore our Proteſtants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the Ancient Church, and taught a new Faith
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102687:73"/> contrary to it, certainly ſome viſible Apparent won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">A new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion muſt have Signs of Truih and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> ſome perſwaſive Sign of Truth ſhould have uſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it in, and ſounded the Trumpet before theſe new Preachers.

Now, and not before, our Eyes behold moſt glorious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Miracles, God certainly ſpeak's by theſe new men</hi> &amp;c. But when we look about us, and find nothing to countenance this <hi>unknown Faith</hi> (which like a <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> came amongſt us) when we hear a <hi>Novelty preached</hi> without either Sign, Motive, or Inducement to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke it <hi>Credible.</hi> When we ſe a new Religion brought<note place="margin">Words only given.</note> in by uncommiſſioned men upon their bare <hi>parole,</hi> and unproved Fancies only: what can we think, But that both <hi>Arians,</hi> and <hi>Pelagians</hi> (yea, and all condemned <hi>Haereticks</hi>) have evidenced as ſtrongly their old Errors, by a <hi>verbal</hi> venting of them, as Proteſtants do now their new Goſpel?

Who was this <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Demand's the Philoſopher? <hi>Poole.</hi> He is God and Man, born of a Virgin, and one that manifeſted himſelf by a moſt Holy Life, wrought many Miracles, Dyed for us all, Aroſe from Death to Life, and afterward Aſcended to Heaven. <hi>Phil.</hi> A ſtrange Story indeed: But can you make the Story credible to my Reaſon? <hi>Poole.</hi> O Sr, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted; For this, and much more, is writ in a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Book we call <hi>Scripture,</hi> And you are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. <hi>Phil.</hi> In a <hi>Book called Scripture?</hi> Here is no Reaſon, for I ask upon what Motive can you make All that is writ in this Book credible to me? And here (becauſe I ſhall inſtantly preſs the point farther) my Demand only is, From Whom you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Scripture, and how long ſince it came to your hands? We had it, ſaith <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

Phil.</hi> What Profeſſors of Chriſtianity had you in the world before your time, That taught truely, and purely the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of your Bible? <hi>Poole.</hi> For a thouſand years at leaſt we know not of any. The beſt I can mention are the later <hi>Graecians,</hi> and yet They highly diſſent from us in points very fundamental, as I read in <hi>Leo Alatius</hi> againſt <hi>Hottinger, Arcudius,</hi> and other Authors. <hi>Phil.</hi> Tell me once more. Had you no Profeſſors<note place="margin">No Paſtors, no Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops.</note> of your <hi>Protestancy</hi> before theſe laſt hundred years, no Proteſtant Biſhops, no Paſtors, no Doctors, that handed unto you this Bible? <hi>Poole.</hi> None at all. <hi>Phil.</hi> That is pittiful, and makes me ſuſpect your Religion. However, ſince theſe laſt hundred years, have you made any known and <hi>notable Converſions</hi> upon Infidels by Preaching the Doctrin of your Bible, or have you wrought <hi>undoubted Miracles</hi> in Confirmation of its Truth? <hi>Anſw.</hi> We muſt Confeſs the want of great Converſions, and of known Miracles alſo. <hi>Phil.</hi> Satisfy me yet further in one doubt? When you are at variance amongſt your ſelves, concerning the difficil paſſages of this Book (which are many,<note place="margin">No cert. Iudge to reconcile differences.</note> for I have read it) who have you to Reconcile thoſe differences, in whoſe certain judgement do you final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Acquieſce? <hi>Anſw.</hi> We acknowledge no <hi>infallible Teacher,</hi> no certain Judge on Earth, every man gives his private ſentiment, concerning thoſe difficulties,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102687:76"/> though not <hi>infallibly,</hi> And 'tis not in our power to do more. <hi>Phil.</hi> Here can be no unity in Doctrin. But<note place="margin">No Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to teach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.</note> ſay on, I beſeech you: Tell me who ſent you to teach theſe <hi>uncertain</hi> Sentiments of your Bible, from whom had you Commiſſion to preach ſuch unſetled Doctrin?

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And here by the way, obſerve your great<note place="margin">Nor by the Purity of it, which is the thing to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> Simplicity in arguing. You prove the Divinity of Scripture by the <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Majeſty</hi> of it. The firſt is in queſtion; For I, who have peruſed Scripture, and find no few ſeeming Contradictions in it, muſt have my doubts cleared, and that Purity evidenced by Proofs <hi>extrinſecal</hi> to Scripture, before I believe it Pure. Concerning the Majeſty of the Stile, Learn your Error. Two things are to be diſtinguiſhed in<note place="margin">The Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of words, not the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</note> Scripture. The Exteriour <hi>Syntax</hi> or <hi>Connexion</hi> of the words we read, which <hi>ſolely</hi> conſidered is common to other pious Books writ by Holy men, without Special Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> And here is all the <hi>viſible Majeſty</hi> that Scripture preſents, either to our
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102687:77"/> eyes or Reaſon, which therfore convinceth nothing.<note place="margin">What ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> The other is (and herein conſiſts the Vertue and Majeſty of Scripture) That God by his <hi>firm Decree, and gracious Ordinance hath pleaſed to ſeal</hi> as it were, <hi>This Book,</hi> and own it as his Sacred Word. Now this <hi>ſignature,</hi> becauſe <hi>External</hi> to the Letter or Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax of Scripture, is no Object of Senſe, nor your reaſon: For you do not evidence it by Antecedent<note place="margin">None pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by his Faith, but his Faith by the Bible antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owned Sacred.

You may well ſay, it is the Object of your Faith, or <hi>Fancy;</hi> But, I hope, you will not prove <hi>the Divinity</hi> of <hi>your Bible by your Faith, but Evidence your Faith by your Bible, Antecedently proved Divine to Reaſon, by good Inducements.</hi> Hence I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that weak Argument drawn from the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> and <hi>Reverence,</hi> which all give to Scripture, And ſay, it carrieth not one grain of Weight with it. For, even Chriſtians (much more Infidels) muſt firſt know upon Prudent Inducements, That the Bible is Sacred, before they Reverence it, and not prove it <hi>Sacred</hi> Becauſe they <hi>Reverence it.</hi> For none proves this man to be a Prince, or Prelate, becauſe he doth him Homage; But therfore He complyes with that duty, becauſe he is Antecedently known or owned for a Perſon of ſuch quality.

They,<note place="margin">And the Scripture.</note> and they alone, can warrant Authentick written Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſhow who writ it, and how it was handed down by continued Profeſſers of their Faith Age after Age, to this preſent day. They, and only they, do ſtill preſerve Vnity in Doctrin, Reclaim Infidels,<note place="margin">Shew their Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials.</note> Produce their <hi>Credentials</hi> for what they Preach, and teach. They only can ſhew to all the World their <hi>Popes,</hi> their <hi>Bishops,</hi> their <hi>Paſtors,</hi> their Doctors, who ſucceſſively have taught and governed <hi>Christs</hi> Flock, ſince the Beginning of Chriſtianity.

Such are the Inducements which plead ſtrongly for the Roman Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and no other. They fully convince Reaſon, and prove, That if God (as I noted above) can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Infidelity and Haereſy by the force of prudential Motives, here they are ſeen; If ever he ſpoke by<note place="margin">As God ſpake an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently by his Prophets and Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, he ſpeak's now by the Church.</note> the mouth of his Prophets, or Apoſtles, he ſpeak's now by the mouth of this one, and <hi>only</hi> Society of Chriſtians; yea, and he yet uſeth (as I may ſay) the ſame powerful Language: <hi>For if the miracles of our Bleſſed Lord, and of his Apoſtles; if their efficacious Doctrin, their Sanctity of life, their Blood shedding were Conviction enough to Infidels</hi> in thoſe days, They are now as forceable in the Church, and as manifeſt to our Senſes; Which cauſed that Bleſſed man <hi>Richard de

For, with ſuch Signs this Doctrin is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, which can proceed from none, but you only. If we ſpeak of unqueſtioned Miracles, as are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſcitation of dead men, More ſince the times of the Apoſtles have been raiſed from death to life, then in the Primitive Age. To deny theſe miracles, is is to deny all Hiſtory which ſupplyes the want of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Thoſe, who ſaw them not. To owm them, to diſown <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> and profeſs <hi>plain Popery.</hi> Our new men Therfore ſpeak at random, when they talk of I know not what <hi>Abſtracted Evidences</hi> for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and Tell us, that the Motives for Scripture are agreed on by all. I anſwered above.<note place="margin">No Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, nor for Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re but by the Church.</note> There neither are, nor can be Motives for Chriſtian Religion in general, if the word <hi>Chriſtian</hi> compriſeth all profeſſed Haereticks; For were it ſo, God would deceive us, and make Falſhood as credible as Truth. No Motives can evidence Scripture, unles they firſt evidence a Church, that indubitably gives us certain Scripture; Which is to ſay, in other Terms: All Motives, as well for the verity of <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> as Scripture, are only to be found in the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, and in no other Society of Chriſtians. If Proteſtants can prove their Faith, or Scripture, by ſo much as a <hi>likelyhood</hi> of either Theſe now Named,<note place="margin">Sectaries are obliged in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to make their Motives known.</note> or any better <hi>Inducements,</hi> They are obliged in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to make them known, that men at laſt may ſe that clear Light of the Goſpel, wherof they end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly talk in their Pulpits. True Candor and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102687:79"/> cannot but ſpeak plainly to this Point without intricate Tergiverſation, if ſo much as a ſpark of zeal lives in their Harts, and Rational Motives do not fail them. We expect a candid anſwer.</p>

One is. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Religion hath been at leaſt for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years Erroneous (yea ſome ſay <hi>Anti-Christian</hi>) it ſtill contradict's the Primitive Doctrin, Holds an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody <hi>Sacrifice, Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatory</hi> &amp;c. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture. Such Doctrins gave Sectaries juſt cauſe, as they ſay, to leave this Church, and <hi>Lash</hi> us ſo ſeverly as they have done, to pull down our Monaſteries, to Banniſh the Ancient Clergy, to Ruin thoſe who profeſſed our Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They were
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102687:79"/> not meer Trifles, nor petty miſtakes which made our <hi>kind harted</hi> Countrymen to uſe us <hi>ſo unkindly.</hi> Here is my firſt Principle granted by Proteſtants. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is as clear, <hi>viz.</hi> That their new Religion of Proteſtancy, as it ſtands now Reformed, is the pure, true, and moſt Orthodox Chriſtian Religion; For, ſet this and the Primitive Church aſide of three or four hundred years continuance, You never yet had (ſay they) any Society of men that taught <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely Chriſts</hi> Doctrin. No God wot, a Deluge of <hi>Popish Errors</hi> overran Chriſtianity for a thouſand years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, until theſe later men brought unto us the Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tydings of their Refined Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon theſe two undeniable Suppoſitions, you ſhall plainly ſe what an Eternal Diſgrace, what Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts Proteſtants will needs put upon our Deareſt Saviour (do what we can to hinder them.) He Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord founded a Church (it coſt him dear, the Effuſion of his Sacred Blood) and promiſed us an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deficient glorious Church to be raiſed out of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yet after all theſe ample Promiſes, he hath<note place="margin">A glorious Church promiſed, and an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure one shewed us of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</note> given us a pittiful one indeed, no better a Thing then Proteſtancy, which is utrerly <hi>diſgraced, obſcur'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor'd,</hi> and quite put down by the <hi>Majeſty,</hi> the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> the <hi>Antiquity,</hi> the <hi>Vnity,</hi> the <hi>Sanctity</hi> of that Church which muſt now, forſooth, be ſtiled Falſe, Erroneous, and Antichriſtian.

Why then is not the Belief of theſe men (all ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture) as good as that of Proteſtants? I think it is (of two Evils) the Better, if more Words of Scripture can more advance the Worth of either Religion. But I tell you, and truly, That neither of them is good, becauſe unreaſonable; and they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:102687:81"/> are therfore unreaſonable, Becauſe no mans Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can in this preſent ſtate of Chriſtianity (whilſt God Govern's us by the Light of Prudence) fall upon a Religion, or Believe a Church which evidently Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears<note place="margin">A Religion without prudent Motives is no Religion.</note> naked, and deſtitute of all Rational motives, inductive to True Belief. Now Scripture alone, without the Interpretation of a Church evidenced by <hi>forcible Motives,</hi> is, <hi>what you pleaſe to make of it.</hi> And a Church not at all manifeſted by rational motives, is no Church, and Therfore cannot interpret Scripture. If you ask why we ſay, That Proteſtancy is ſo bare of Motives and conſequently no Church? I have anſwered above.

To Deny, as I ſaid above, all Miracles to this Church, even the greateſt (as is the <hi>Rayſing of

               <p n="6">6. Some may yet ſay.

               <p n="2">2. All know that the <hi>Objective Verities</hi> writ in Holy<note place="margin">Objective Verities, and the belief of them diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</note> Scripture, and the <hi>Belief</hi> of thoſe Verities in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Hart, are to be diſtinguiſhed.

                  <hi>Objective Verity</hi> as it lyes in Scripture; For if that could ſave us, it would be enough to put a Bible in ones Pocket, And ſay here is the Faith that <hi>ſaves me,</hi> Though I know not what is in it, or Believe Amiſs.

A greater Probability can ballance nothing in this or the like particulars, as I ſhall largely prove hereafter. In the mean while, by what is now ſaid, we may learn firſt. Though Scripture in this and other <hi>Myſteries</hi> hath its Darknes, yet by the good Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Almighty God we are provided of a Sure Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, which is abſolutely <hi>Neceſſary:</hi> For if Every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne interpret according to fancy, Haereſy is eaſily Drawn out of Gods Word; And if none interpret Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, the Scripture ſtill lyes hid in Obſcurity, which makes it (for that part) a Uſeles Book to Chriſtians.<note place="margin">The necſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an infallible Interpreter.</note> Learn farther, That None can ever know exactly by Human Induſtry, or his Sole pondering the Bible (let him be another <hi>Salomon</hi> for Wiſdom) what God hath Revealed in theſe <hi>difficil Myſteries</hi> of our Faith, without an Infallible Interpreter. To prove my Aſſertion I'll give you one Inſtance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Suppoſe that two or three moſt learned Heathen
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102687:93"/> Philoſopher, well verſed in Languages, and all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Literature,</hi> had this Book of Scripture put into their Hands, and were perſwaded by the <hi>extrinſecal</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoohers reading the Bible.</note> Authority of all Chriſtians, that God here ſpeak's his <hi>Eternal Verities:</hi> Withall, That if they read the Book, and by their <hi>Sole</hi> reading (without Recours to any Interpreter) poſſeſs the True ſenſe of it, They have True <hi>Saving Faith.</hi> Well: They read it, and with as much Humility as any Proteſtant can do, yet<note place="margin">If They ask of none but Their own Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</note> Ask of none, But <hi>their own judgement</hi> what it means, in the more difficil Paſſages. Tell me, I beſeech you, (And here I appeal to the <hi>moderate Iudgement</hi> of every Chriſtian, whether Catholick, Arian, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant) What Faith or Religion would theſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers produce out of <hi>Sole Scripture, Solely</hi> Read, and pondered by them? My Thought is ('Tis no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re but a Thought) That the <hi>Reſult</hi> of their Reading would end in Coyning a Religion different from all Others now in Chriſtendom. I am very confident, They would never pitch upon Proteſtancy, no, nor<note place="margin">Their doubts would be Endles.</note> upon any Sect now extant. Alas, they would Doubt and Stagger at every hard paſſage in Scripture, yea, and by the very <hi>Inſtinct of Nature</hi> (if they own'd Scripture for Gods Book) would humbly <hi>Supplicate</hi> Thoſe, who gave them the Book, to lay open the Myſteries therin, and Aſſure them of its <hi>meaning</hi> in a hundred Places; yet none can do this good office for them, But One only Society of Chriſtians that layes claim <hi>to Infallibility,</hi> and proves it Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, if Faith be in the World.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be it how you will: thus much I conclude. Our Proteſtants are in the very ſame Caſe without
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102687:93"/> an <hi>infallible Interpreter,</hi> as the Philoſophers are with<note place="margin">Sectaries are in the very ſame caſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter.</note> 
                  <hi>no Interpreter:</hi> Theſe make Scripture ſpeak what <hi>They think</hi> it ſpeaks, right, or wrong, And Proteſtants do the like, whilſt They give their ſentiment on Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries above their <hi>Reach</hi> without an Infallible Teacher. Pray you Reflect. Had <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and his Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les never Taught any thing by Word of Mouth, But only thrown the Book of Scripture amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Strange Confuſions Had</hi> Chriſt <hi>and his Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les given to Chriſtians a Bible without an Interpreter.</hi>
                  </note> when They left the World, and commanded them to make that uſe of it, which every <hi>Private Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement</hi> thought beſt, what a Religion, think ye, ſhould we have had at this day in Chriſtianity, any or none, or a thouſand <hi>different ones</hi> as good <hi>as none?</hi> God only knows, I do not; Yet will ſay, This is out very preſent Condition, if an <hi>infallible Interpreter</hi> of Scripture be Rejected. We may wrangle to the<note place="margin">Diſſentions would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve followed without hope of union.</note> Worlds end, but agree in nothing; Diſpute, but conclude nothing; we may raiſe Difficulties one againſt another, But allay none. And thus the <hi>conteſt</hi> muſt run on, without Redres or Remedy. All Appellation here to Antiquity, to Councils, Fathers<note place="margin">Appellation to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being fallible with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</note> and Tradition help's nothing, Becaus they <hi>are Falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> And were they otherwiſe, we vary <hi>as highly about the Sentiments of Fathers</hi> in every <hi>debated point</hi> of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, as we do about Scripture <hi>it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. We ſe thirdly: How utterly impoſſible it is for a Proteſtant to draw, from the <hi>Objective Verities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed</hi> in Scripture, the True Senſe and meaning of Gods Word in any <hi>controverted</hi> point of Religion. The Reaſon is. Scripture never ſpeak's plainly and expreſly the Proteſtants <hi>Senſe</hi> in theſe debated Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, (obſerve it in All, and you'll find it ſo.)
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102687:94"/> What do they therfore to help themſelves? They firſt Reject an Infallible Interpreter, and next (as the <hi>Arians</hi> do) ſuperadd their own Fallible gloſſes to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<note place="margin">Sectaries make Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to ſpeak what They would have it ſay, not what God ſpeak's.</note> Scripture ſpeak, not what it <hi>Truly ſays,</hi> But what They would have <hi>it ſay,</hi> And thus they think Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cleared, and Their Work don.

Juſt as the Arian ſaith: <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> and ſuperadds his Gloſs, of <hi>one in Affection,</hi> ſo the Proteſtant here <hi>vitiates</hi> the Text by his Gloſs, and adds to Scripture (what God never ſpoke) a <hi>Trope,</hi> a <hi>Figure,</hi> a <hi>Sign,</hi> and I know not what. And after This Injury don to the Words, He Believes not for Gods <hi>Expreſs Word,</hi> But, for his own far-fetcht and dear bought <hi>Interpretations,</hi> which are no more Scripture then if he ſhould tell me, That,<note place="margin">An Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> That text of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102687:94"/> are all <hi>Human</hi> and <hi>Fallible.</hi> O, but to ſay, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> Body is Really Preſent under the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread, yea and in a thouſand places at Once, is an <hi>Vnintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Myſtery!

Theſe are Higher Myſteries and greater Difficulties, If Human Reaſon might be judge, and give a final Sentence.

               <p n="6">6. We ſe thirdly: Though Proteſtants Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize<note place="margin">The whole Religion of Protestants is nothing els but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to Scripture, or ſubtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from it.</note> all that <hi>Add</hi> to Gods Word, or <hi>Take</hi> from it, yet I'll tell you, Their whole Religion (as <hi>Proteſtancy</hi>) is either <hi>made up</hi> of no Scripture at all, or, is nothing els but a meer Addition of their own Gloſſes to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or, finally a wilful Subtraction from it.

               <head type="sub">Sole Scripture without an infallible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter can be no Rule of Faith. Proteſtants have no Scripture for their Religion, as it is Proteſtancy.</head>
               <p n="1">1. MY firſt propoſition Draw's Proof enough from the precedent Chapter; For if Scripture be
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102687:96"/> Obſcure, and ſpeak not clearly all Verities revealed in the book, it cannot <hi>Regulate</hi> Faith without an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter.</hi> But 'tis more then evident, that it ſpeaks not <hi>clearly</hi> many Verities Concerning the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Myſteries of Religion; Therfore it cannot Regulate Faith relating to Theſe Myſteries, without an <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter.</hi> I prove the <hi>Minor.</hi> Scripture which ſolely conſidered according to the <hi>Exterior Letter,</hi> both <hi>may,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The bare letter of Scripture may and doth eaſily beget error.</note> and <hi>Doth,</hi> as eaſily beget <hi>Error</hi> as <hi>Truth</hi> in the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Power of man, Speak's not clearly. (Whence it is that <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Auſtin Tom. 10. Serm. 70. de Tempore,</hi> ſtiles Haereticks <hi>Infelices,</hi> Unhappy, Who only look on the Sound of words in Scripture, which is, ſaith he, like a <hi>Body</hi> without a <hi>Soul.</hi>) But it is as clear, That the bare Letter of Scripture (without a ſure Interpreter) beget's Errors, And therfore an <hi>Arian</hi> Becaus He Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates his Belief by the meer <hi>Sound</hi> of that Text <hi>Iohn 14. My Father is greater then I,</hi> Err's damnably. And the like All other condemned Haereticks have done in their reſpective Errors, drawn as they thought, from Scripture. <hi>Ergo</hi> it is evident, that the Letter of Scripture ſpeak's not Clearly in this one moſt High Myſtery, And therfore cannot Regulate Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Interpreter. Now further. <hi>If this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A fallible Interpreter as uſeles as no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter in points of Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>be fallible, He is as Vſeles to Christians for the Regulating of Faith, as if he were no Interpreter, For He may Deceive them, And if we be deceived, it much imports not, whether the Error proceed from Obſcure Scripture miſunderstood, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreted by an other.</hi> An infallible <hi>Interpreter</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is neceſſary in this Weighty matter, that Aſſures us of what God hath ſpoken, of ſuch and ſuch Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102687:97"/> Myſteries. <hi>And here we Reſt ſecurely, and have a moſt certain Rule which Sectaries want.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Again I argue. If Sole Scripture be a clear <hi>Rule</hi> of Faith, it can <hi>Regulate</hi> without Gloſſes, yea, and without a Preacher too. Why therfore do our Proteſtants charge that one Text above cited, <hi>This is my body</hi> (the like we may ſay of many others) with ſo unneceſſary a burden of their Interpretations? Are<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Are Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries affraid that</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſpoke too plainly?</hi>
                  </note> They affraid that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpoke too Plainly, and therfore Add their Gloſſes to Obſcure his Words? None will own ſuch an Impiety. Then I ſay: They are Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Clear an <hi>Obſcure Paſſage,</hi> conſequently, They<note place="margin">They gloſs to make Scripture clear.</note> muſt acknowledge an Obſcurity in this Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their tampering with the Text, and gloſſing it. Well. But when They have gloſſed all they can, I ask what is it that <hi>Regulates</hi> their Faith in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Their gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes regulate their Faith, not the words of</hi> Chriſt.</note> Do <hi>Chriſts</hi> Words as he ſpoke them, or, as They interpret, Regulate here? Not the firſt: For 't is moſt evident, that <hi>Chriſts</hi> own Words without the Proteſtant Gloſſes, can never beget in any Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>determinate</hi> Belief, which theſe men have of the Bleſſed Sacrament; For, the words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſay plainly, <hi>This is my Body that is given for you;</hi> Which pondered to the day of Judgement, can never yeild this <hi>forced,</hi> repugnant, and <hi>far-fetch't</hi> Senſe, <hi>This is a Sign,</hi> or <hi>a Figure</hi> of my Body. Yet ſuch is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> drawn from this Sentence, by their Interpretations. Wherfore, we muſt conclude that They Believe not for <hi>Christs</hi> Sole Words, But for their <hi>Additional Gloſſes,</hi> which is to ſay in plain Engliſh, Their <hi>Overplus of Gloſſes Regulates Faith, not Gods Expreſs and moſt ſignificant Word.</hi> Some will ſay this Paſſage
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102687:97"/> now cited, muſt be interpreted as They will have it, Becaus Scripture in other places ſeem's to favor their Interpretation. I anſwer candidly. Let them<note place="margin">They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cite one Text out of Scripture in favour of their Gloſſes.</note> but produce ſo much as one plain Text out of the whole Bible, for the Alienating of this Sentence from its <hi>proper Senſe,</hi> without Gloſſes (which are no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) and I'll proclaim them <hi>Conquerours.</hi> Here is plain dealing, but Remember well, <hi>I call for Scripture only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I told you juſt now, That as theſe Gloſſes are uſeles, if ſole Scripture be a clear Rule of Faith, ſo are Preachers alſo, yea and all the large Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> have writ on Scripture. Why? Gods Word ſpeak's clearly without a Preacher:<note place="margin">If Scripture be Clear, ther's no need of Teachers.</note> 
                  <hi>Away</hi> therfore with Preaching, and Commentaries. 'T is enough to thruſt a Bible into mens Hands, And bid them read it, <hi>For there is True Doctrin, and plain Doctrin, but more is not required to Regulate Faith, then</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> 
                  <hi>Truth and Clarity; Ergo,</hi> Miniſters may hereafter well ſpare their labor of Preaching, and 'tis better they did ſo, Then to be in danger of perverting Gods true Word, by their fallible Talking.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To conclude this matter, we have already am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply proved, That it is not the <hi>Bare Letter</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> which <hi>Regulates Faith,</hi> Buth the exact and true Senſe of it (<hi>Ne putemus,</hi> ſaith <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Hierom in cap. 1. ad Galat. v.</hi> 11. Let us not think, that the Goſpel lyes in the Words of Scripture, but in <hi>their ſenſe. Non in ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, ſed in medullâ,</hi> not in the <hi>Out-ſide,</hi> but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Pith and <hi>Marrow</hi> of it, <hi>non in ſermonum foliis</hi> &amp;c.) But, no Proteſtant, with ſo much as any colour of Reaſon, can lay a more juſt claim to the true Senſe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:102687:98"/> of Scripture, when He and the Church <hi>ſtand at Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Protestants as uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the true Senſe of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, as Arians are.</note> Then an <hi>Arian,</hi> a <hi>Pelagian,</hi> or a <hi>Donatist</hi> can do, when They draw Scripture to Their Senſe. All of them are alike, guided by meer <hi>Gueſſes,</hi> and firſt <hi>Read,</hi> next <hi>Think,</hi> then <hi>Iudge,</hi> and laſtly <hi>Believe.</hi> Believe what? What Their Private Iudgement Tell's them, and here is the laſt Rule of their Faith,<note place="margin">All of them gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by gueſſes. Three parts of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> wherof more in the next Chapter. In the interim, you may Reſolve a Proteſtants <hi>Belief</hi> into theſe three broken <hi>Shreds,</hi> or <hi>Fragments.</hi> The firſt part is that, <hi>wherin They hold with Catholicks: And here they have the true Senſe of Scripture interpreted, yet no True Faith, for want of Submiſſion in other Points.</hi> The other part is that, <hi>wherin They agree with Ancient condemned Haereticks: And herein, They have neither the True ſenſe of Scripture, nor true Faith.</hi> The laſt part is proper to Themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves <hi>as Proteſtant; And here they have not ſo much as the Letter, or a Word of Scripture for them: much les any true Senſe, or Faith grounded on Scripture.</hi> And</p>
               <p n="5">5. Upon this occaſion I come to mind <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poole,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The want of Mr. Poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les fourth Propoſition.</note> of the Want of his fourth Propoſition, viz. <hi>That Scripture ſpeak's plainly the particular Tenents of Proteſtant Religion,</hi> as <hi>Proteſtaniſm.</hi> And muſt Tell him: He ſhall never find in the whole Bible, ſo much as one <hi>Article</hi> of Proteſtant Religion (as it ſtands in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Catholick Doctrin) grounded on Scripture. And, Becaus The man may not perhaps like of too great a burden, I'll only urge him to Prove theſe three Proteſtant <hi>Aſſertions. 1. That there are two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions for Mr. Poole to Prove.</note> 
                  <hi>and no more;</hi> But let him not think to turn me of, as he doth the Captain, with meer empty and inſignificant Words, <hi>Appendix page 34. Scripture is plain
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102687:98"/> enough in deſcribing the nature of two Sacraments.</hi> He ſhould have added; And 'tis plain in deſcribing the <hi>number alſo,</hi> and given good Scripture for both, which cannot be don. 2. <hi>That Faith only Iuſtifies.</hi> 3. That, after he hath better pondered the Text of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Peter</hi> 2. 3. 16. He prove by Scripture, the <hi>Plaineſs of it in all neceſſary Points to Salvation.</hi> A fourth proof, concerning the Canon and Certainty of Scripture, would choak <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poole:</hi> But I'll not give him ſo undigeſtible a pill, may He pleas to ſatisfy the three former Demands by Scripture <hi>only,</hi> without Gloſſes and ungrounded Inferences drawn from what he thinks to be Gods Word, <hi>But is not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Some perhaps may ask why all this time, whilſt we have Diſcourſed of Scripture, of its <hi>Certainty,</hi> of its Senſe, and Regulating Faith &amp;c. None of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> Arguments againſt us are taken notice of? Hath he none, or do I Diſſemble them? I anſwer. The man hath nothing like an Objection. To prove Scripture to be the Word of God, He Relyes on the Confeſſion and Teſtimony of Catholicks. This<note place="margin">Mr. Poole hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like: Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> we have Refuted above. To prove it <hi>uncorrupt</hi> in the Eſſentials of Faith, He Tell's us, that by looking into the <hi>Nature and quality</hi> of thoſe <hi>Various Lections,</hi> which are pleaded as Evidences of Corruption, we ſhall quickly find them to be in Matters of les Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It ſeem's They are little, Becaus <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poole</hi> without Proof will have them ſo. I could ſhew him great ones in the Proteſtant Bible, But let them pas, And be pleaſed to note how poorly he ſhifts of the Difficulty That Preſſes. The Difficulty is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beſt Originals, which Proteſtants have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:102687:99"/> met with (none of them I believe ever yet ſaw the <hi>Autograph,</hi> or Hand-writing of either an Euangeliſt or Apoſtle) Theſe <hi>Originals,</hi> I ſay, cannot be proved Uncorrupt, if that Church which had them in Cuſtody for a thouſand years, brought in a Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of Errors into the Chriſtian World. Finally to prove, that a Proteſtant hath a Sufficient Aſſurance of Underſtanding <hi>the Senſe</hi> of Scripture in things Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Saluation, He allegeth Gods Promiſe, <hi>Iohn 7. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the Doctrin whether it be of God:</hi> But Proteſtants <hi>do Gods will</hi> (thus much muſt be added, or the Proof ſtands on one Leg) and <hi>Papiſt Do not Gods will; Ergo Thoſe have</hi> Aſſurance of the true Senſe of Scripture, and <hi>Theſe have</hi> not. Here is the doughty Argument, and that which follows is as weightles. Proteſtants, ſaith He, have the Aſſurance of Reaſon (Papiſts have no more) and if that will not do, They have the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the <hi>Spirit</hi> which God promiſeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Luk</hi> 11. Here is work enough for another Chapter: Yet in paſſing I cannot but reflect on a miſtaken quotation<note place="margin">

If they ſay no, it
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:102687:108"/> is againſt his Goodnes to permit ſuch a Univerſal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.

Therfore they are inſufficient to found Divine Faith. The Major is granted by Proteſtants. The Minor, <hi>viz,</hi> That theſe ſuppoſed Truths were<note place="margin">Ergo, <hi>Cannot be Articles of Proteſtant Faith.</hi>
                  </note> never ſpoken by Almighty God in Scripture, is ſo undeniably evident, That here I am forced to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge Sectaries to produce ſo much as one Text, wherin God hath Poſitively ſaid: <hi>There is no Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, No real Preſence</hi> &amp;c. This they cannot do by ſo much as by a probable <hi>Deduction</hi> from Scripture,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:102687:114"/> much les by plain Scripture it ſelf. The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion<note place="margin">An Evi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion againſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries.</note> therfore follows evidently. They <hi>Believe not what God hath Revealed, and conſequently want Faith in the Articles they Aſſent to as Proteſtants.</hi> Nay, I ſay mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. They cannot Aſſent to Theſe Articles as <hi>evident Truths;</hi> For no received Principle either in Nature or Grace can evidence ſo much as the <hi>ſuppoſed objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve</hi> Verity of Theſe Doctrins. Shall I yet add a word, and ſay, That no Proof grounded upon <hi>weighty moral Reaſon,</hi> can evidence, theſe <hi>negative Aſſertions</hi> to be Truths morally known? Therfore though hitherto we have ſuppoſed them to paſs for Verities, yet in real earneſt <hi>They are unproved and no other, But the weak Thoughts of our Adverſaries ſtrong Fancy?</hi> Now here, If I miſtake not, <hi>You ſe Ruin enough of Proteſtant Religion,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. To conclude this point, I Argue thus. Theſe Negative Articles, <hi>No purgatory, No Church infallible</hi> &amp;c. Are either eſſential Pieces of Proteſtant Religion, or not. If not: There is no ſuch thing as Proteſtant <hi>Religion</hi> in the world; For the Reformed part of it, is <hi>wholy</hi>

Caſt then theſe, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke away, <hi>Protestancy</hi> dwingles to nothing. Now, if on the other ſide, They hold theſe as Articles of Proteſtancy, And ſay, They ought to be believed by Divine Faith, They are obliged to ſhew (which is utterly impoſſible) that God hath Poſitively reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in Scripture. Therfore I ſay: <hi>Though we
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:102687:114"/> Admit of ſuch Negatives as Objective Truths in Themſelves, yet, ſo long as they are not proved to be poſitive revealed Truths, or, Spoken by Almighty God,</hi> Proteſtancy ſtands like a <hi>Starveling,</hi> void and empty of all <hi>revealed Truths,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proteſtancy as ſo, hath no one part of its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by God.</note> And conſequently, as it is, this New Religion, hath no one part of its Doctrin warranted by him, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds all Chriſtian <hi>Verities,</hi> I mean Gods <hi>certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi>

For, no man can imagin that Gods Intention is, That we only Read, without Arriving to the Senſe of <hi>what we Read,</hi> or, which is wors, that we fall <hi>into Error by our Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Providence hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded means, wherby we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Scripture.</note> This therfore, Providence hath Prevented by one Means or other, if careleſly we do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it. We may thirdly Suppoſe, That God, regularly ſpeaking, Reveal's to no Private man the deep Senſe of Scripture (when He Reads and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps underſtands it not) By private Illuſtrations, new Enthuſiaſm's, or the Miniſtery of Angels, Therfore<note place="margin">Private Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions no uſual means.</note> ſome other way is Appointed by Providence to come to the True Senſe of what He Reads.

The Truth of my Aſſertion ſtand's firm upon the undeniable Grounds already laid, no leſs well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then preſuppoſed. Here is the ſumme of All.<note place="margin">A ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the precedent proofs.</note> 
                  <hi>The wiſe Providence of God hath left Sufficient means wherby we may know exactly the Senſe of his Scripture, in matters concerning Saluation, whilſt Learned men of different Sects are at endles Debates about this Senſe, and perſiſt moſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly in what they have once laid hold on. God therfore, moſt aſſuredly, will not have us run on thus in jarr's to the worlds end, and conclude nothing. There is means then of a Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation afforded, if we pleaſe; But that's not Scripture alone, which cannot interpret it ſelf, but lyes ſtill in that ancient darknes, as it was firſt writ; nor can it be mans Private Iudgement, for that is both Various and Fallible. Certainly it is not the Proteſtants Spirit, For this we ſe changes every year, And, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly, is Destitute of the Holy Ghoſts Infallible directing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. It is no condemned Sect of Ancient Haereicks, acknowledged for ſuch both by Catholicks and Proteſtants. Enthuſiaſm's no man believes, Angels interpret not Scripture. What then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, but that we have recours to that One, Ancient, Holy, and Vniverſal Roman Church, as wel for Inſtruction, as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</hi> By this ſole Oracle the Holy Ghoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret's and teacheth, or we muſt grant (which is lamentable) that we are turned loos into an inexplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Labyrinth of Gods deep Secrets revealed in his Word, without hope of finding any <hi>Exit.</hi>

               <p n="11">11. To prove my Aſſertion further poſitively by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and the Authority of Fathers, would be both tedious to a Reader, and little avail with Sectaries (And I wave as much as may be the uſeles Repetition of ſo often quoted Authorities) who turn of Scripture by far-fetcht Gloſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and undervalue Fathers as being
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:102687:122"/> fallible: Yet while they do ſo, know well enough their own miſery at home, within their breſts, which is nothing but a <hi>Spirit of Fallibility.</hi> You find Proofs am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply alleged out of Scripture, Councils, and Fathers to our preſent matter, in our Polemical writers, chiefly when they treat of the Iudge of Controverſies.

The Deceaſed Apoſtles now in Heaven will ('tis true) ſe this laſt Day; But are not now with us, nor, Teach until that <hi>Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> be. Therfore Others Succeed and teach in their Place (ſo God hath ordered) to the End of all things. I have Anſwer'd to what is added of their preſent Inſtruction by the Written Word.

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:102687:124"/> inſtruct them when they Fail, or miſtake Gods True Senſe. This very Scripture therfore requires an Interpreter, in whom all muſt <hi>Acquieſce,</hi> or we may run on in endles Diſſentions to the day of Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement. But yo will ask, Who is in fault, Seing no man blames himſelf nor the Bible He read's? <hi>Chriſt</hi> Anſwer's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He <hi>who hears not the Church,</hi> is both the accuſed and faulty Perſon. And upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I anſwer to a ſecond Objection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our adverſaries may ſay. All Appellation from a Lower Tribunal to a Higher is lawful. And they do ſo: For, they Appeal from the Church (which only conſiſts of men) to God and his Word, <hi>the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sectaries by appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign from the Church to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</note> 
                  <hi>Tribunal</hi> imaginable; therfore their Procedure is blameles. I anſwer, It were moſt blameles, could They know Infallibly what God certainly ſaith in his Word; But this they cannot know in controverted Points, But by the Infallible Oracle of his Church. To this Tribunal <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſends us for Satisfaction in all<note place="margin">In real Truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal not to Scripture, but to Fancy only.</note> our Difficulties; If we reject or forſake this Oracle in real Truth, we appeal not to the <hi>undoubted Senſe</hi> of Gods Word, But to our own unſteedy Sentiments; which are <hi>Fancies</hi> only, and nothing like Gods Word. Will you ſe this clearly? Imagin only a new ſort of Sectaries, who will both Appeal from Church and Scripture to Gods interiour and eternall infallible<note place="margin">This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves the Aſſertion.</note> knowledge of Truth: They Appeal from the Church, <hi>Becaus it is made up of men;</hi> from Scripture, becauſe <hi>They understand it</hi> not in a hundred Paſſages. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will rely on what God knows to be True, and gueſs at it as well as they can. Would you not eſteem ſuch Men mad, and upon this Account, That they cannot certainly know without a Teacher, what
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:102687:124"/> this Infinite Wiſdom judgeth of the Truth they ſeek<note place="margin">Obſerve the proof.</note> after? This is the very caſe of Sectaries. <hi>No more do they certainly know in their Principles, what God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Revealed in that one Text: This is my body</hi> (and the like is of innumerable others) <hi>then if he had never Regiſtred thoſe Words in Scripture.</hi> They may gueſs at the Senſe and miſs, more they cannot do. Now if they tell me of no man knows what Moral Certainty, or of Fundamentals clearly enough made known in Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, we Anſwer fully to both in the next Diſcours.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They may thirdly object. If a Proteſtant can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not depoſe his Judgement, nor, think that the Church and Scripture ſay one thing, Becaus his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon finds them Oppoſite <hi>to one another,</hi> He may ſtand for Gods Word, againſt the Church. To confirm this, He may tell us alſo, that the Church, which<note place="margin">An Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ground of all Hareſy,</note> ſeem's to engroſs all Judicature and right of Interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture, is no more but a <hi>Party,</hi> and a Party cannot in Reaſon be Iudge for it Self, when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant ſtands out, and is in Controverſy with the Church. <hi>Here briefly is the Ground of all Haereſy, and the old Plea of all Condemned Sectaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. To Anſwer the firſt. I Ask what is this Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant<note place="margin">Is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> that cannot Submit his Iudgement? Is he an Angel from Heaven, or one immediatly Taught by the Holy Ghoſt? No. He is a poor, ſimple, falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and erring Man. Why then may not he yeild to the Church, as well as his Anceſtors have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and the Wiſeſt part of Chriſtianity doth now? The true Reaſon is, Becaus he perverſly <hi>will not ſubmit,</hi> And, <hi>though he palliat's his Pertinacy with a Specious Pretence of Gods Word,</hi> yet he hath not one Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:102687:125"/> in Scripture for him: The moſt He can know (if yet ſo much) is, that what he reads is Scripture, but what God ſaith in that Scripture he cannot know at all but by Fancy only, when he judgeth contrary to the Church. O, but God Illuminates him about<note place="margin">A paradox of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants illu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minated.</note> the Senſe. Why you, my Friend, more then an <hi>Arian,</hi> as <hi>Strong</hi> in <hi>Fancy</hi> as you are? But, why you more then a whole Ancient Church? Doth God tender you ſo dearly, and not his Church? <hi>Will he</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And of a whole Church left in Darknes.</note> 
                  <hi>Illuminate you, and leave his Church in Darknes? Will he give you the Spirit of Infallibility,</hi> and <hi>take it from his Church?</hi> Away with theſe Trifles, not worth Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>neither God, nor Scripture, nor Church is here ſtood for,</hi> But a <hi>Self-conceipt only.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Church no Party, but Iudge.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Now to what is Added of the Church being a Part, and therfore no Iudge, I'll ſay one Word, and firſt ask what is the Sectary that oppoſeth himſelf to the Church? Is not he a Party alſo? Will He then take upon him to Iudge and cenſure the Church. <hi>And cry out againſt it</hi> (as partial) <hi>if it meddle with him? The Church is already impowred by Chriſt to Iudge in Spiritual Cauſes,</hi> as I have proved; <hi>But no Particular man is more</hi>
                  <note place="margin">'Tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> 
                  <hi>Authorized to Iudge the Church, then a Vaſſal is to Iudge his Sovereign after Treaſon committed.</hi> And the Inſtance is fit, as you may ſe; If ſome in a Kingdom tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly riſe up againſt both King and Country, as Sectaries have done againſt the Pope and Church. They are accuſed and brought to a Trial, before their lawful Sovereign; the Fact is examined, whether Treaſonable or no. Will theſe impeached Men, think ye, fly from the Judgement of their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> or plead He is a Party, and therfore ſeek for Juſtice
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:102687:125"/> to <hi>a Forreign Prince?</hi> No moſt certainly. The King<note place="margin">The Church the high Tribunal from which there is no appeal.</note> and Country where they offend have Power to Iudge them; And ſo hath the Church <hi>in Spiritual matters,</hi> from which there can be no <hi>Appeal.</hi> And the Caſe is moſt Evident for the Church: Becaus, whilſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries by their Schiſm or new Doctrin contrary to it, become Rebels, <hi>They have no Tribunal imaginable left them to Appeal to, ſecluding this Iudge, But their own Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judgement, which is the Delinquent.</hi> The Church thus<note place="margin">Sectaries make the Delinquent Iudge.</note> rejected; <hi>Neither God Immediately, nor Scripture more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly, nor Angels Miniſterially judgeth for them; Therfore their laſt Appellation is to a very Friendly and too partial a Iudge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Too partial a Iudge.</note> Their own <hi>what they Pleaſe.</hi> And this is moſt evident in every debated Controverſy, where no other Judge is allowed of by them but Scripture (and it were well would they ſtand to it) <hi>But it is Scripture, as They are pleaſed to Interpret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. They may Object fourthly. Thoſe <hi>Apostles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Euangeliſts, Paſtors, and Doctors</hi> mentioned in the Text, Though granted Infallible, are againſt all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuppoſed to be the Teachers of the Roman<note place="margin">The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe of other Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, beſide thoſe of the Roman Catholick Church,</note> Church: For moſt ſurely, There were other Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Teachers beſide theſe, continued Age after Age in the world. Why therfore doth the Church of Rome draw all that's good to it ſelf, and Allow no other Chriſtian Society at leaſt <hi>a share of theſe Doctors</hi> and Teachers &amp;c? Mark the Objection which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges a Succeſſion of other Orthodox Paſtors and Teachers in the Chriſtian World, Age after Age,<note place="margin">Shewed Null.</note> And take with it my plain Anſwer. If Sectaries lay claim to ſuch, They are obliged plainly to point them out, And ſay where, or when they lived, who they
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:102687:126"/> taught &amp;c. But they are not deſignable, Becaus, from <hi>Luthers</hi> days upward There were none (except the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Paſtors) in the Chriſtian world, But known con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and condemned Haereticks, And They were no Orthodox Teachers, as I largely prove in the firſt <hi>Chap.</hi> of the next <hi>Diſcours.</hi> Be pleaſed to read it. They may Reply fifthly. This Argument: <hi>Such Paſtors are not</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Reply anſwered.</note> 
                  <hi>deſignable, therfore were not,</hi> is purely <hi>negative</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves nothing. Well. But I hope this Propoſition Aſſerted by Proteſtants. <hi>Such Paſtors and Doctors diſtinct from the Roman Clergy, were Succeſſively</hi> found to have been in the World, is <hi>Poſitive,</hi> And therfore muſt be proved. However, Negative Arguments in ſuch matters, and of the like nature with this (That is, when things are of themſelves Perceptible, and yet not Seen) Are both ſtrong and Convincing. For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:<note place="margin">When ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments have force.</note> If a company of quick ſighted men ſtand up in a tower ſet before a plain, and look round about them, yet ſe nothing within the compas of the eye like a high Mountain; They may well conclude, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is no ſuch Mountain within their ſight. Now I ſay: A Church conſiſting of ſuch Suppoſed Orthodox Paſtors, as Proteſtants imagin, Diſtinct from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, is as viſible, and diſcernable as a Mountain in this preſent Caſe, Yet, were never ſeen by Proteſtants nor others. Therfore it follows They were not at all, unles we recurr to an Inviſible Society of ſuch men, now as well exploded by later Proteſtants, as Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A fifth Objection flow's from the pen of a Late<note place="margin">Mr. Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet.</note> Writer after this manner. <hi>Cannot you conceive that there should be a Number of men profeſſing Chriſtianity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:102687:126"/> Infallibility? If not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I'll help your Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a little.

Though the Creed Compriſeth much in that One Article, <hi>I believe the Holy Catholick Church</hi> (And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome Ancient Fathers moſt Deſervedly Magnify the<note place="margin">Proteſtants cannot plainly point at the Church which the Creed Call's Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</note> compleatnes of it, as an Excellent <hi>Summary</hi> of Chriſtian Faith) yet Proteſtants for their lives, cannot ſay, what or where this Catholick Church is, And it is very hard to oblige me to the Belief of <hi>a Church,</hi> which is neither known nor can be Pointed out.

To Omit, that the Creed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers no Explicit Doctrin concerning Baptiſm and the Euchariſt (Though the Belief of theſe are alſo Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation) Thus much I obſerve, That Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,<note place="margin">Catholicks Admit of the Creed without Gloſſes.</note> without Gloſſes and Interpretations, own the candid and plain Obvious Expreſſions of the Creed in

               <p n="3">3. I muſt Needs have a word with my long forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Friend <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

               <p n="4">4. From this Conceſſion of our Adverſaries I infer,

No Catholick voluntarily Oppoſeth Himſelf to ſo much as to one <hi>Iota</hi> of Gods Word Sufficiently Propoſed, nor, can He, and Remain Catholick. 3. He cannot Thwart his Judgement of Diſcerning, or, go Againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in Believing Catholick Religion; For by Doing either, He looſeth Faith. 4. As long as He is A Cordial and Sincere Believer of the Roman Catholick Faith, He can have no Evident Demonſtrations againſt it, Or Tax this Church of Errour, or, if <hi>in Conſcience</hi> He Do ſo, <hi>eo ipſo,</hi> He ceaſe's to be a Member of This Church, And is no longer Orthodox.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yet I ſay More.

Otherwiſe (which is impious) We might blame His Goodnes, and Tell Almighty God. You, O Lord, Aſſure us in Scripture of our Final Beatitude, But you have (with it) left us

               </p>

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:102687:157"/> There muſt be a Vnion in Belief by which The Church is Conſtituted in Being, Antecedently to its new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions.</hi> Very Good.

In a Kingdom, or Commonwealth, There is always an Agreement, or Settlement in ſome great Matters before it Proceed to make new Laws; yet, 'Tis not<note place="margin">Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths though an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently ſetled may make new Laws.</note> conſequent to ſay, That the Agreement ought to be <hi>ſo Explicit in all Things, in all Points, in all particular Matters,</hi> that nothing afterward can be Decreed anew. It is Therfore ſufficient, That theſe new Laws Ariſe from ſome firſt ſolid Principles of that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, <hi>Antecedently ſetled</hi> in Being, And if this be ſo, They oblige as Much as the former Conventions Did, when it was firſt ſetled: <hi>Though they were not at all mentioned, at the firſt Founding of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. Anſwerably Hereunto, One may ſay. <hi>Chriſt</hi> founded a Church Aſſiſted, as is here Suppoſed, by a Spirit of Truth, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and firſt ſetled it upon ſome fewer Principles, from which <hi>All other after-Definitions might Proceed, or be Derived.</hi> The<note place="margin">The Church aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives new Definitions from its firſt Setle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Church thus Aſſiſted, Defines anew upon the former Setlement, juſt as the Commonwealth makes new Laws, upon its firſt Agreement. Such Definitions Therfore, becauſe they <hi>Proceed from an Infallible Oracle</hi> (call them yet new, or old as you pleas) Are as certain, <hi>and of as great neceſsity to be Believed, As thoſe new Laws are Obligatory, and of neceſſity to be Obeyed.</hi> Here is one Diſparity which is not to the Purpoſe, <hi>Viz.</hi> That the Commonwealths Laws proceed
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:102687:158"/> from Human Authority, The Churches Definitions from Divine Aſſiſtance. Thoſe oblige under a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral<note place="margin">The parity holds exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> Puniſhment, Theſe under Eternal.

Now further. As no man Doubt's, But, That the Church may make new Laws in <hi>order to Obedience;</hi> ſo none can but moſt Vnreaſonably Doubt of its Power in Setting forth new Definitions. It is very True: Here may be much of a <hi>Quaeſtio de Nomine, Whether They are to be called Old</hi> or <hi>New,</hi> Becauſe of their different Reſpects. Relating to the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<note place="margin">Vpon diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reſpects theſe Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions may be called either new or old.</note> Foundations of Chriſtian Doctrin, from <hi>whence They Proceed,</hi> They may take a <hi>Denomination</hi> and be called <hi>Old,</hi> Becauſe <hi>Radicated</hi> in Thoſe old certain Principles. But, if we conſider them as more <hi>Ample, Expreſs,</hi> and <hi>ſignificant Declarations of Gods Eternal Truths,</hi> They may, without Offence, or Claſhing, in the leaſt with <hi>Church-Doctrin,</hi> be called <hi>New Definitions.</hi> Thus much is Briefly ſaid, to ſhow how groundles our Adverſaries Grounds are.</p>
               <p n="21">21. But we will not leave the Difficulty Thus. To Anſwer therfore with more ſatisfaction, Be pleaſed to note. <hi>It is one Thing to own a Church perfectly Founded,</hi>

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:102687:158"/> Propoſition made by ſome <hi>Oracle of Truth</hi> of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Doctrin, As is evident in Scripture it ſelf: <hi>For, though I own all that Scripture ſaith to be True in the Senſe intended by the Holy Ghost, yet, I muſt learn by a ſure Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, what it ſaith in a hundred difficil Paſſages.</hi>

               <p n="22">22.

And here, one Grand Cheat is to be taken Notice of. Sectaries Think that All thoſe Chriſtian Truths which the Apoſtles Believed Explicitly, are now Explicitly enough upon Record in Holy Writ. It is an Errour. Our Saviour, as <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.

               <p n="23">23.

               <p n="6">6.

To confirm This, Our young Antagoniſt Ask's; <hi>Whether the Apoſtolical Declarations of the Ancient Primitive</hi>

A ſecond Objection leſs to the Purpoſe. <hi>The Teaching Church either Believes in that Inſtant Sht Defines a thing Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Saluation, or doth not.

Firſt, it is an undeniable Verity, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> founded a Catholick Church, And 'Tis as Evident (Sectaries Confeſs it) that He inveſted the Roman Catholick Church in an Ancient Poſſeſſion of Truth. 2. It is an undoubted Verity, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt <hi>Abandoned not the Church He Founded.</hi>
                  </note> never abandoned the Church He founded, For He told us: <hi>Hell gates should not Prevail againſt it.</hi> He gave Aſſurance of his being with us <hi>to the end of the world.

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:102687:188"/> Roman Catholick Church in Truth, it is Orthodox ſtill, and Preſerved in Truth by His ſpecial Aſſiſtance. 3. It is an Evident Verity, that God, whoſe Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce never Failed his Church, could not permit this Ample, and Ancient Moral Body of Catholicks to Cheat the world by its pleading a Poſſeſſion of Truth; if 't had none, for a thouſand years together, <hi>when,</hi> (which is deeply to be Pondered) <hi>there was not any</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Truth well to be Pondered.</note> 
                  <hi>other ſound Church on Earth, for ſo vaſt a time, to Teach Chriſtians the Orthodox Faith of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> 4. We ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve our quiet Poſſeſſion Acknowledged by innumerable Votes of moſt learned Fathers. 5. And 'Tis a Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Proof (For nothing, Scripture excepted, can Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel it.)

And who can ſuppoſe that all thoſe Innumerable Profeſſors of this learned Church, by whom this Evidence was conveyed Age after Age, were all beſotted or deluded with Errour? 6.

If Finally, The Authority of our Church, And the Testimonies of moſt Ancient Fathers may ſpeak in our Cauſe, And this Convincing Proof alſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve place. None (Ever Gainſaid our Ancient Poſſeſsion But know and condemned Hereticks.</hi> We may well Hope to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence our Adverſaries at preſent, or, if theſe Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Reaſons, with many other, Inſiſted on Hereafter, Become inſignificant to Their Obdurate Harts, when They can not ſpeak a Reaſonable word Againſt our Evidences, what ſhall we Do, But Commiſerate Their Condition?

               <p n="10">10. Obſerve therfore. If they ſay, our Saviour<note place="margin">What They are to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve.</note> once ſetled not the Roman Catholick Church in Truth, They are to Prove it. If they ſay, He violated His Promiſe, And preſerved not the Church, He founded in Perpetual Truth, They are to prove it. If They ſay, We miſunderſtand the Scriptures now cited, They are to Prove. If They ſay our Catholick Church cheated the world for ten whole Ages together by pretending Poſſeſſion of Apoſtolical Verities when it had none, They are to Prove. If they ſay our Church was once Sound in Faith, but failed After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, They are to Prove, And withal, Diſtinctly to point <hi>at ſome other Orthodox Chriſtian Society, that Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:102687:189"/> in the place of the Roman Church, now</hi> (falſly) <hi>Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Fallen into Errour,</hi> And This will give Sectaries work enough. Again: If They Slight The Authority, and Teſtimony of our Church, Evidenced by moſt glorious Miracles, And other Illuſtrious Marks of Truth, They are to give, in Lieu of that, a more Valid Teſtimony, a ſtronger Authority For Their Pretenſes, which is impoſſible. If Finally, They Talk of any Orthodox Church. That plainly Cenſured, or, Condemned the <hi>Roman</hi> of Errour and Hereſy, (And Herein we Vrge Them to ſpeak to the Cauſe) the Proof lies ſtill on their ſide: or, if they Prove not. Believe it, our OLIM POSSIDEO, is impregnable; The Preſciption, and clear Evidence of a long quiet Poſſeſſion, are our wall of Defence, not to be battered, or Beaten down by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies.</p>

No Probability can Acquit them of Schiſm, when Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce layes That crime on them, But this is True; And

               <p n="3">3. Yet, I cannot But Note how improbable it is, To Suppoſe, That All thoſe learned Councils which Anciently Taught Chriſtianity; All thoſe Learned Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, Thoſe Doctors, Thoſe Religious, who like Stars Beautified the Terreſtrial Heaven of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick<note place="margin">It is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to ſay that Sectaries Diſcovered Errours in the Church unſeen by Thouſands more learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous then They.</note> Church for a Thouſand years Together, <hi>Had, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Their Vigilancy, ſuch a Miſt caſt before Their Eyes, as not to Diſcover Thoſe Palpable Groſs Errours which our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants have now ſo lately Eſpied.</hi> Say Therfore (the Queſtion is worth Anſwering) How came it to paſs, That our Proteſtants firſt ſaw theſe Errours, And upon that <hi>Monſtruous</hi> Sight Quitted <hi>Rome,</hi> whilſt Others As Sharp-ſighted, as Numerous, And learned as They, Saw none of them for many Ages Before?

               <p n="4">4. When this Schiſm was firſt made by a few Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted men in England, Why did ſo many, not only in that Iland, Though temporally Vndon for their<note place="margin">The Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition made ſo Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally againſt this Schiſm proves it monſtruous.</note> pains, But innumerable more in the Chriſtian World abroad Stand up Againſt it, and Oppoſe it on its firſt Appearance, as a moſt Pernicious Novelty?

               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="5">5. The fifth Propoſition. <hi>By how much the Societies are greater, which are agreed in not Communicating with a Church impoſing ſuch conditions, By how much the power of thoſe who rule thoſe Societies ſo agreeing is larger; By ſo much</hi>

                  <hi>the more juſtifiable is the Reformation of any Church from tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Abuſes, and the ſetling the bonds of Christian Communion without them.</hi> Here is the <hi>Theſis,</hi> And a Thing, like an <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> comes limping After, as well as it can, Thus. <hi>On theſe grounds, the Church of Rome Impoſing unlawful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Communion, it was Neceſſary not to communicate with

That They Only had the good Luck to hit Right,</hi> whilſt All Foregoing Sectaries, who Abandoned the Roman Church, <hi>Were,</hi> and, yet <hi>Are</hi> tainted with groſs Corruptions. The Reaſon why both They, and All other Hereticks that left the Mother-Church, are in Errour, is drawn from the Impoſſibility of doing the Work They have gon about: For, it is not in mans power to change or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Religion. No. <hi>Only one High Prieſt</hi> (God and man) <hi>Once made a change,</hi> who was <hi>Holy, Innocent, Vndefiled, Separated from ſinners, and made Higher then the

               <p n="4">4.

For, All know, when the guilt of a mortal<note place="margin">God cannot de potentiâ ordinariâ punish a ſin eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which is not, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Deny it poſſible de potentiâ abſolutâ.</note> Sin is remitted, which is an <hi>exigency</hi> or an <hi>intrinſick</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity to Eternal puniſhment, <hi>that punishment, eo ipſo,</hi> is remitted with the guilt, unles you ſay, that God can puniſh a ſin which is not, and this for ever. It is true, an exchange from the eternal, to a temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is made by Almighty God through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> when the due means preſcribed for

He ſtates next the Controverſy between the Greeks and Latin Church upon this ſubject, and ſaith, <hi>The main thing objected by the Greeks againſt the Latins vvas this temporary punishment</hi> for ſin in a future ſtate. Sir, I muſt now ſpeak to you, and ſay your Aſſertion is an unproved ſuppoſition, And very untrue as will preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Miſtakes, in Stating the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</note> appear. Neither doth the Apology you ſo blindly quote <hi>Ed. Salm.</hi> ſo much as Probably favour it. Mark your own Tranſlation. We own no <hi>Purgatory fire,</hi> nor any temporal puniſhment <hi>by fire.</hi> The conteſt therfore was not concerning a temporal puniſhment preciſely Conſidered, For The Greek Church never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed a puniſhment, but about the particular <hi>Pain by fire,</hi> And this purgation by fire, ſome of them perhaps might think (though moſt weakly) ſlackned the<note place="margin">Obſcurity.</note> endeavours of the Diligent if your quotation be true, for I wonder why you run to <hi>Ed. Salmas</hi> when you<note place="margin">No man here knowes what Ed. Salmas ſignifies.</note> have at hand the Pariſian, the Venetian, the Cullen Editions, with others. Now, that which I Aſſert is without Diſpute moſt certain, as Appears by the <hi>very Definition</hi> of the Council of Florence under <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Fourth, where the Greeks with their Emperour, and Patriarch of Conſtantinople met, and Conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Latins Defined thus. <hi>Item definimus ſi ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>

<pb n="437" facs="tcp:102687:233"/> purged by the pains of Purgatory. Thus much you might have read in <hi>Alfonſus à Caſtro,</hi> whom you cite lib. 12. Tit. Purgat. at the end of the Title.

Nay, He ſaith more, that the Greeks then aſſembled in that Council, publiſhed a book <hi>Ad probandum Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torij locum</hi> to prove the place of Purgatory, which book was printed at Baſil both in Greek and Latin. And here by the way you may Obſerve another fraud of Sectaries, who if they find a piece of a ſentence ſeemingly favorable for them, that's layd hold on, and whatever clear's the Expreſſion or makes againſt their<note place="margin">Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of Difficulties proper to Sectaries.</note> miſtaking it, That's waved and diſſembled. But let us go on. You Oppoſe againſt the Councils De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition <hi>Marcus Eugenius</hi> utterly refuſing to ſubſcribe it. What is it to the purpoſe whether He did or no? Was his ſole vote Enough to unvote, or make null the ſentiment of a whole Council? O, ſay you, He would never have don ſo, Had all the Controverſy<note place="margin">The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Marcus Eugenius weightles.</note> been whether the Fire was <hi>real or Metaphorical.</hi> How know you that but by your prooſles Gueſſes only? <hi>Beſides,</hi> that was not the Controverſy.</p>

               <p n="7">7. I'll tell you a great Truth, and 'tis worth a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reflection.

We <hi>read no ſuch word as Purgatory</hi> in the Ancient Fathers. 2. You may ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve a Company of blind inferences drawn from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Fathers before the ſenſe of either be Agreed<note place="margin">They make Deductions from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before the ſenſe of Scripture is known.</note> on. 3. As far as Conjectures can reach, they will ſet Gloſſes enough upon the beſt Teſtimonies allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able out of Scripture or Fathers &amp;c. But mark it, all this while you have Nothing <hi>Expreſs,</hi> nothing <hi>Poſitive</hi> and <hi>ſignificant</hi> againſt us. And Do they think that a meer Negative Argument hath force enough to overthrow a Doctrin Poſitively Profeſſed by a whole Church, and ſo many Learned Fathers? Can they perſwade Themſelves that Their Inferences Forced from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Fathers, are of any validity, whilſt the very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of both lye under Diſpute? Take for an inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<note place="margin">An Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.</note> that of <hi>S. Iohn Apocal. 14. Bleſſed are the Dead that Dye in our Lord, Amodo,</hi> from hence forth they reſt from Their labours. The Queſtion is, what <hi>Amodo</hi> relates to, whether to the day of every mans Death, or to the laſt Judgement Day? whether the Scripture ſpeak's there of perfect Souls only, or of others? what is meant by that word <hi>labours;</hi> For if it ſignify the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferances and perſecutions of this preſent life, the Text Proves nothing for our Adverſaries. Notwithſtanding
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:102687:245"/> all theſe Doubts undecided, Their Inference goes on. And 'tis, that <hi>S.

Yet you have no better from theſe men. <hi>Nothing Expreſs, nothing openly ſignificant</hi> Againſt us.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I touched in the laſt place on Sectaries Gloſſes and interpretations, forced on ſuch Teſtimonies, as are uſually cited for our Catholick Faith. And here<note place="margin">How diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks and Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</note> I will briefly Diſcover not only their <hi>Cheat,</hi> but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over ſhew you how differently we and They proceed as well in this preſent Controverſy, as in all other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes between us. Obſerve well, The Truth is thus. When we Produce Scripture, Councils, or Fathers againſt their Novelties, They make their own Interpretation to be the <hi>laſt and ſureſt Ground</hi> wheron<note place="margin">The Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry makes the laſt ground of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to be his own Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick hath his Religion proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He Explicates.</note> Their maintained Opinion ultimatly relies. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe, the Catholick never interpret's Scripture or Fathers alleged by Sectaries, but He <hi>ground his Gloſs on a ſurer Principle</hi> then his ſole Explication reaches to. I will explicate my ſelf more clearly by one Inſtance. Beſides the Authority of our Church, and all other Societies called Chriſtian, we allege (for example) <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Denis</hi> his Teſtimony, <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Chryſoſtoms,</hi> or any other to prove that Prayer for the Dead Avail's much for their comfort and remiſſion of ſins, that is, for the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening of the pain due to ſin. The Sectary inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret's Theſe and the like paſſages as his own <hi>Fancy</hi> ſuggeſteth, And if this Fancy hit not right, <hi>He is undon,</hi> for He hath no ſurer Principle to rely on, either in this or any other Controverſy, but His own ſelf
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:102687:245"/> conceipted Gloſs. The Reaſon is: He hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible<note place="margin">All ſure Principles fail Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> 
                  <hi>Church,</hi> no clear <hi>Scripture,</hi> no undoubted conſent of <hi>Fathers,</hi> no Vniverſal <hi>Tradition</hi> diſtinct from his Gloſs that can ſo much as make it <hi>probable.</hi> Therfore his own unproved interpretation Doth all; it is his laſt <hi>Principle</hi> and Strongeſt <hi>Hold,</hi> He never goes Higher, nor can advance one ſtep further. I am ſo confident of this Aſſertion, that I challenge our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to come to a juſt trial in this one Controverſy;<note place="margin">A fair Offer.</note> And if He can Anſwer to our Authorities now quoted, upon the Aſſurance of plain <hi>Scripture,</hi> undoubted Tradition, or the plain Conſent of Fathers, I'll cry <hi>Peccavi,</hi> and Ask forgivenes of my raſhnes. Thus they proceed.</p>
               <p n="9">9. On the Other ſide, when the Catholick inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets Scripture or Fathers alleged by Sectaries againſt his Faith, He never makes <hi>his interpretation to be the</hi>

The Sectary ſaith His belief is againſt Scripture. (<hi>Wiſdom 3. The ſouls of

So far Therfore, There can be no Difficulty; The only Strife will be How They'l co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me off in their Anſwers, And, Whether They are able to Satisfy Two or Three Arguments, Which I ſhall Propoſe upon moſt grounded <hi>Suppoſitions.</hi> If I be not much Deceived, We ſhall ſe how Fancy all along, or ſomething wors, Vphold's Their new Opinion. You muſt here Expect plain Language, For Truth is never better ſeen, Then when plain Words ſet it forth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To proceed clearly. We may firſt Suppoſe,<note place="margin">Two neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</note> That as God hath Certainly Revealed the Truth of this Myſtery of the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament</hi> in Holy Scripture, ſo He hath alſo Taught us, What we are Truely to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve concerning it. We Suppoſe 2. That his real Intention, was, and is, That we ſtand to his Word, and Believe Him as he Speak's, Vnles, we can Learn by ſome clear and Vndoubted <hi>Principle,</hi> That he ſpak Reſervedly, or, That his words bear another Senſe then what they plainly Signify. Vpon theſe Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions I Argue. When God Reveals a Truth in Holy<note place="margin">A clear Argument Propoſed againſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries.</note> Scripture, which concerns the General Belief of all, And <hi>really Intends</hi> to Teach Chriſtians what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They <hi>are to Believe</hi> of that Revealed Truth: He cannot Deliver <hi>more ſignificantly, clearly, and expreſly,</hi> that Doctrin which He would not have Chriſtians to <hi>Believe,</hi> Then He Doth the Doctrin which He Would have them to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:</hi> For, if He did ſo, (whilſt We cannot Learn by any known Principle, That He ſpeak's otherwiſe then He Thinks) He would not only Equivocate, and Deal reſervedly with us in a Weighty matter of Faith (And
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:102687:255"/> this as Ill beſeem's his Goodnes as to Speak an Vntruth)<note place="margin">God in a weighty Matter of Faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deliver more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, which He would not have Chriſtians to Believe. Then he Doth the other which He would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve them to believe. If God cannot make a fals Religion more credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Then his true Religion is, He cannot deliver an errour not to be Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re plain and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant words, then he uſeth when he ſpeaks a Truth, to be believed by All.</note> But more; if we Rely on Scripture only, He would Induce the whole world to Believe a Falſity. Now I Subſume. But, it is moſt Evident, (if Sectaries Say right) That God, in ſpeaking of this Myſtery, Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that Doctrin more clearly, And ſignificantly, Which He would not have Chriſtians <hi>to Believe,</hi> Then He doth the other, which He would <hi>Have them to Believe,</hi> And, there is no Imaginable Principle, wherby we can learn that he Spake otherwiſe then He Thought, or his plain Words Signify, Therfore he ſpeak's not only E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocally, and Reſervedly in a weighty matter of Faith (<hi>which is Alwayes to be Reflected on</hi>) But, He Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth alſo the whole Chriſtian World, if Scripture gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de us, to Believe a Falſity by His too plain Speaking.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Before I prove the <hi>Minor,</hi> And give you this Clearer Language of Almighty God, For <hi>what He will not Have us to Believe</hi> &amp;c. Be pleaſed to call to mind, one Truth Explicated more largely <hi>Diſc. 1. cap.</hi> 8. For it is the Ground of my Preſent Diſcours. Vpon that <hi>Principle</hi> therfore, I ſay now Again. As God cannot (if True Faith be in the world) make a Fals Religion more Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently Credible to Reaſon by the force of rational Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Then His True Religion is Evidenced and made Credible (<hi>For, if he did ſo, He would oblige Reaſon to Embrace a Falſity, and Deſert Truth</hi>) So alſo, when He De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers a Doctrin Concerning Chriſtian Faith (And, in the moſt ſerious Circumſtances imaginable) He cannot Deliver an Errour in more Emphatical and Plainer words <hi>Then He ſpeak's a Truth,</hi> which yet, You Shall ſe, is Don, if Sectaries be Believed. The Parity Holds Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, For, As thoſe more Perſwaſive Motives, Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent

Thus much ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Here is my Propoſition, and an Inference alſo.<note place="margin">A Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Sectaries.</note> 
                  <hi>Sectaries cannot by virtue of any one of theſe now Named Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, VVithdraw Catholicks from the Plain Received Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of Chriſts VVords.</hi> They cannot Prove that EST, in our Saviours Affirmation, Imports only as much, as if you ſaid, it <hi>Signifies.</hi> Therfore the Doctrin which Denies the real Preſence of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Body in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is wholy Vnwarrantable, and Built on Fancy Only.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Proofs of my Aſſertion are as Vndeniably<note place="margin">The Proofs of it, are no leſs clear, Then the Propoſition it ſelf.</note> Evident as the very <hi>Aſſertion it ſelf;</hi> For it is Manifeſt, No Scripture plainly Teaches (I ſay no More now) That the Verb EST, in <hi>Christs</hi> Propoſition Beares only this ſenſe, it <hi>Signifies:</hi> And it is as Clear, no Vniverſal Tradition Approves of this new Fancied <hi>Senſe.</hi> What then Remains, But that our Adverſaries take Recours to ſome Ancient Orthodox Church, or, To the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſent of Fathers? I ſay therfore. If they<note place="margin">A Fair of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer made to Sectaries.</note> can Name any Vniverſal Church, Nay any particular
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:102687:261"/> Church <hi>Reputed Orthodox</hi> the whole world Over, That Interpreted theſe Words as They do, or, Clearly <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed Chriſts</hi> true Body and Blood To be under the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi> of Bread and Wine after Conſecration, or, Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that Natural bread only hath the Name of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Body, Though it be Really no more But a <hi>Sign</hi> only, a <hi>Figure</hi> only, a <hi>Reſemblance</hi> only of his Body; If, I ſay,<note place="margin">Protestants you shall ſe, will never Anſwer Directly, to what is here propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> any one of theſe things can be proved. They'l Come of Gloriouſly, And Gain Thouſands to their Opinion. But I know, all is in a high Meaſure Impoſſible. I ſay, a <hi>Sign</hi> only, a <hi>Figure</hi> only; For, We Catholicks both ſpeak with the Fathers, and Truely Believe The Euchariſt to be a Sacrament, And conſequently a <hi>Sign</hi> of Inviſible Grace, Yea, and a <hi>Figure</hi> alſo, a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Himſelf and his Sacred Paſſion; But this is not the Controverſy between us, The ſole Queſtion therfore is, Whether it be ſo <hi>purely a Sign</hi> or <hi>Figure,</hi> that<note place="margin">What They are to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer To.</note> the <hi>Thing Signified</hi> is not in the Sign, And the <hi>Verity</hi> in the <hi>Figure,</hi> That is. Whether <hi>Chriſts</hi> Sacred Body and Blood, be not <hi>Truely</hi> and <hi>Subſtantially</hi> within the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sign, and really Preſent There? This <hi>VVe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,</hi> and <hi>Sectaries Deny,</hi> Though never Orthodox Church Denyed it with Them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To clear this Point, And Add, If Poſſible, more Weight to our Aſſertion: We Have an Ample, Holy, and Learned Catholick Roman Church (whoſe ſole Authority, ſet Scripture aſide, is the Greateſt on Earth)<note place="margin">The ſole Authority of our Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, is Sufficient to Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce Sectaries of Errour.</note> Which confeſſedly hath believed and taught this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Real Preſence for at leaſt a Thouſand Years (I ſay Ever ſince Chriſtianity began) And, can any one prudently Perſwade Himſelf, That ſo Chois, and Learned a Society, That yet <hi>Speak's in Christs ovvn Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi>
                  <pb n="493" facs="tcp:102687:261"/> And Literally believes his words as They are in the Goſpel, Hath, for ſo long a time lived in a <hi>Cheat,</hi> and taught <hi>Millions</hi> of Soules a moſt Damnable Errour? Admit of this Vaſt Improbability, We have yet a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration<note place="margin">No Other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety Ever oppoſed our Catholick Doctrin.</note> againſt Sectaries: And 'tis: No Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Church can be named that ever Oppoſed, Found fault, or Blamed the Belief of the Roman Church Concerning this Myſtery. Therfore the Doctrin of this Learned Society is undoubtedly <hi>Certain,</hi> upon a double Account, that <hi>Chriſt Taught it,</hi> And no Vniverſal Church ever <hi>Condemned it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. In the laſt Place we are to Say a Word of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">The laſt Principle which is the conſent of Fathers.</note> Principle, Which is the Vnanimous conſent, not of a ſmall Number, but of Many moſt Ancient, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Holy Fathers, Theſe can well Declare what Scripture Teaches of This Myſtery, And what <hi>Chriſts</hi> Orthodox Church ever Believed. If All Readers Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve not the Originals at hand, They may ſee them in the Authors Cited above, I ſhall only Hint at a few, For to Tranſcribe All, or Half of them, And Quote the Places Exactly, Would Needleſly lengthen a Digreſſion, which I Intended to make ſhort.

               <p n="8">8. Some Fathers therfore Dogmatically Teach: What we take into our mouths, is not that which <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>

Wherfore, with all Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty let us take this <hi>Body and Blood of Christ: For his Body is given thee under the Form of Bread, And his Blood is given thee under the Form of wine, Although ſenſe tell thee Otherwiſe,</hi> yet let <hi>Faith confirm thee in this Truth.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Of Infallible Teachers, and the Motives of Credibility.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>CHriſts</hi> Church hath infallible Teachers of true Chriſtian Religion. <hi>Chriſts</hi> infallible Doctrin requires infallible Teachers. A Doctrin that is fallible may be fals. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſent none to teach any other Doctrin but that which may be reſolved into Gods certain Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but ſuch a Doctrin can neither be fals nor fallible. Sectaries preach no other Doctrin but what is fallible and may be fals. The Objective infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of Gods Word in Scripture is not <hi>ex terminis</hi> Evident, and no Church (as They ſay) Ever yet told them or can tell them infallibly, that it is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If all Paſtors and Doctors may err in their delivery of Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, God would as indifferently oblige us to believe a lye, as his certain verities. If God deprive all Paſtors of infallible Aſſiſtance, Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion now ſtands on no more firm ground then mans weak, mutable and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring opinion. Gods infallible Revelation avails nothing in order to Faith, unles Chriſtians lay hold on the certainty therof by Faith which cannot be don, unles that Oracle which propoſeth the Revelation to all be infallible. If the Proponent of a Revelation only ſay doubtfully. I think God ſpeaks as I preach, but am not certain, the Aſſent given to his Preaching is alſo doubtful, and no Faith. Faith ſurpaſſeth in its ſtrength and Tendency, all moral and Metaphyſical certainty. Though Moral certainty were ſufficient for Faith, yet Sectaries have not ſo much for Proteſtancy, as it is reformed. How Sectaries err in their ſearch made after Religion, and both weakly and improbably op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn the Doctrin of the Catholick Roman Church. Reflections upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of credibility. It is impoſſible (after the eſtabliſhment of true Faith in the world) that God permit a fals Religion to be more clearly evidenced to reaſon by force of rational Motives, then true Religion is manifeſted. A fals Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion cannot equalize Gods true Religion in the evidence of prudent motives, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to Faith. No Religion hath motives founding moral certainty (prere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to Faith) but the Roman Catholick Religion only. Proteſtants have
<pb facs="tcp:102687:282"/> nothing like rational motives, wherby Proteſtancy, as <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> is proved to be ſo much as probable.

               <p>SCripture is a uſeles book in the hands of Sectaries, if none, as they confeſs, Declare infallibly the ſenſe of it in high points of Controverſies. Arians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret Scripture as probably as Proteſtants, when they oppoſe the ſenſe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Church. Sectaries make Scripture a book, that proves all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, and more ſignificant for Arianiſm then Proteſtancy. The fallacy of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants concerning the Interpretation of Scripture, is diſcovered. Grant no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Church, we have no Aſſurance of true and interrupted Scripture. Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture might be more eaſily corrupted then a whole Church cheated into fals Doctrin. No man can prudently ſuppoſe, that God had more care to preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve Scripture uncorrupt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then a Church free from errour. All Subſtantials of Faith are not in Scripture. A Learned Philoſopher by his own reading Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture cannot judge what it meanes in a hundred Paſſages without an Interpreter. Sectaries now are in the very ſame caſe without an infallible Interpreter. Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in their Gloſſes on Scripture do nothing but add, and ſubſtract from Gods Word, When They Oppoſe the Churches ſenſe of Scripture. Sole Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re without an infallible Interpreter, can be no Rule of Faith. Proteſtants ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve not one word of Scripture for their Religion, as it is <hi>Proteſtancy.</hi> The Reaſon of private men, or of a private ſpirit cannot interpret Scripture. The new mode of Proteſtants miſinterpreting Scripture is amply refuted. All our Sectaries endeavour is to turn Scripture off from the Catholick ſenſe by their own fancies, and then think the work don. It is one thing to ſay (and only to ſay it) that Scriptures alleged by us prove not what we intend, and another poſitively to prove the Doctrin contrary to us to be grounded on Scripture, In this Sectaries always fail. The new mode of Sectaries interpreting Scripture deſtroyes Proteſtant Religion. Here is the ſequel of Sectaries. We Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks Prove not what we aſſert, therfore they make the contrary Doctrin an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of their new Faith. Faith cannot rely on ſuch Negatives. Of the means left by Almighty God to interpret Scripture. The Holy Ghoſt only, ſpeaking by the Oracle of the Church, Interpret's Scripture infallibly, in thoſe matters
<pb facs="tcp:102687:282"/> which concern the general belief of all. Proteſtants, who profeſs themſelves to be fallible in what ever they teach, are no Inſtruments aſſumed by the Holy Ghoſt to teach and interpret infallibly Gods Word. No Sectary can judge the Church, but the Church is to judge all Sectaries.</p>

               <p>PRoteſtants, who ſeemingly hold a Catholick Church before <hi>Luther</hi> larger then the Roman Catholick Church, and cannot deſign it, Proceed unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, and muſt falſify that Article of our Creed. <hi>I believe the Holy Catholick Church.</hi> Before <hi>Luther</hi> there were no Chriſtians in the world for a thouſand years, at leaſt, but Roman Catholicks, and known Hereticks, neither thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks alone (as Proteſtants ſay) nor the known Hereticks (nor both together) conſtituted the true Catholick Church, therfore there was no true Catholick Church on earth for ſo vaſt a time. No abſtract Doctrin common to all, who are named Chriſtians, is ſufficient to conſtitute Catholick Doctrin. <hi>Mr. Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> is confuted, and his Doctrin ſhewed improbable. Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> only, as a Redeemer, is inſufficient to Saluation: A more explicite Faith of other particulars is proved Neceſſary. If Catholicks and Sectaries are right in the fundamentals of Faith, all the pretended Reformation of Proteſtants comes to a ſlight work about <hi>Non<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eſſentials,</hi> which may have made Things wors then before. It is not the leſs or more weight of things revealed that makes Faith leſs or more valued of, but the Submiſſion we yeild to Gods Veracity, which is one, and of equal Authority in what ever he Reveal's. Though a Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction were granted between Fundamentals and not Fundamentals: Yet Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants cannot ſo much as probably ſever the Fundamentals from the others by any known Principle. If there be no Catholick Church owned (at leaſt) infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Fundamentals, all Faith both of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Creed may periſh before the world end's. And if there be ſuch an Infallible Church in Fundamentals, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries ought to deſign it, and ſay, to whom that Spirit is granted, in what ſubject it reſides &amp;c. A Proteſtant, who ſo far Denies <hi>Chriſts</hi> true Church, That he cannot ſay where it is, and endeavour's to reform others before he have certainty of his own half well made Reformation, cannot probably go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to withdraw a prudent Catholick from his Religion. Some Propoſitions of <hi>Mr. Stillingfleet</hi> are examined. His Diſcours of Fundamentals deſtroy's Proteſtant Religion. He Speaks of the <hi>Being</hi> of a Church and ſaith not preciſely how much Doctrin conſtitutes that Being. He cannot name any Orthodox Church that ever Excepted againſt the Articles believed by the Church of Rome. He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes the Negative Articles of the Engliſh Church not to be Articles of Faith, but
<pb facs="tcp:102687:283"/> only inferiour Truths held only in order to peace and tranquillity. His Church therfore is eſſentially Hypocritical, which may believe one thing and muſt profeſs an other. Though Proteſtants were very Papiſts in hart, yea, and Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized all Theſe Negative Articles, They may be looked on as Bleſſed Children of this new Negative Church, if their Exteriour be fairly Proteſtant-like. He makes his Church no more an Engliſh Church then a Church of Arians, and of all condemned Hereticks. He ſaith the Engliſh Church makes no Articles of Faith, but ſuch as have the Approbation of the whole Chriſtian world and of Rome it ſelf.

If the ſecond be granted: They have no Divine Faith at all of the Bleſſed Sacrament. The Nullity of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ground's is declared, though the Church made new Articles of Faith. If we ſpeak rigourouſly, The Church makes no new Articles, but only declares more Explicitly what was anciently believed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Fathers call the Church a rich Treaſury wherin the <hi>Depoſitum</hi> of Apoſtolical Doctrin is ſecurely preſerved. The Analogy of Faith is explicated. There was a Platform of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion before Scripture was Writ, and the Apoſtles ſeparated Themſelves and Preach't to ſeveral Nations. Sectaries who ſeemingly acquieſce in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one or two Ancient Fathers, moſt inconſequently reject the Authority of a Learned General Council that is of greater weight and Eſtimation. If the Churches Definitions are therfore to be thought fallible, becauſe men declare them, and all men are lyars; much more are our Sectaries Novelties and Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on Scripture to be valued of as Fallible upon the ſame ground. Theſe falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men tell me my Churches Doctrin is fallible, ſuppoſe falſly it were ſo, it is altogether as good as this very fallible Propoſition is that ſayes 'Tis Fallible; and if (which is true) it be infallible, it is much better.

                  <p>THe Separation of Proteſtants from the Roman Catholick Church, is as plain and manifeſt a ſinful Schiſm, as ever was Decryed Rebellion in a Kingdom, or any Violation of a Countries Right. The formal Schiſm of Sectaries, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but the Cauſal charged on Catholicks, is no more but an unproved Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Proofs brought to received Principles fail Sectaries, whilſt they make the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church to be the cauſe of their Formal Schiſm. The ſuppoſed errours char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the Roman Catholick Church by Sectaries are not like the firſt Principles in nature, Evident <hi>ex terminis,</hi> and therfore muſt be proved by a Diſcours ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on certain Principles. We Licence Sectaries in their Diſcours againſt us, to make uſe of all Imaginable ſound Principles, Scripture, Fathers, Tradition, or what They pleas, and only exclude Their own ſelf-voting from the nature of a rational Proof and Principle. When a Rebellion is manifeſt in a Kingdom, the ſole Authority, of them who began it, is inſufficient to make it Juſtifiable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the Authority of Sectaries is as forceles to Juſtify their Evident Schiſm againſt the Church. Whilſt Evidence comes not againſt our Church, it ſtand's moſt firm upon its ancient poſſeſſed right. This long Poſſeſſion proves our Church Orthodox. Examples Hereof. <hi>Mr. Stillingfleets</hi> Exceptions againſt our plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poſſeſſion, are proved to be weak, forceles, and meer ungrounded Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. Though the Obligation of proving Evidently lies on our Adverſaries, who are the Aggreſſors, yet we prove not only a perſonal Succeſſion of our Popes and Prelates in forgoing Ages, but alſo manifeſt a Quiet Poſſeſſion of Truth that deſcended with theſe continued Popes and Biſhops from the dayes of <hi>S. Peter</hi> to this very Age. No juſt Exception can be made againſt our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which is Evidently its one Proof, for there cannot be a clearer. <hi>Mr. Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi> ſuppoſeth that our Right of pleading Truth is a meer Occupancy. He is to prove this becaus he is the Accuſer. No Antecedent Law hath determined Contrary to what we Challenge by vertue of our Poſſeſſion. We have both the Law for us, and ancient Poſſeſſion, beſides; And there is no Reaſon when we allege two Proofs, Law and Poſſeſſion, that we Quite the one, which is Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, as <hi>Mr. Stillingfleet</hi> pretend's we ſhould do, which is againſt all ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Diſcours of this ſubject. It is improbable to ſay, that Proteſtants firſt ſaw theſe ſuppoſed errours imputed to our Church, when others as Quick-ſighted, more numerours and Learned then They, ſaw them not for ten whole Ages before Luther. It is a degree of madnes to ſuppoſe, that all thoſe worthy and Learned Profeſſors of the Catholick Faith were either ſo ſtupidly blind, as not to have ſeen ſuch ſuppoſed errours, or ſo wickedly Hypocritical as to have wincked at them, after their plain Diſcovery. It is a Paradox to ſay, that our
<pb facs="tcp:102687:284"/> new men ſaw theſe too plain and viſible errours, when that great Catholick Church (which Sectaries make more large then the Roman) ſaw them not, but permitted Rome to countenance theſe ſuppoſed errours, without check or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. Of the Impoſſibility of errours entring the Church after the firſt 4. or 5. hundred years. Though Sectaries ſhould convince (which is impoſſible) the Roman Catholick Church to be guilty of errour, yet they cannot ſhow that they have ſet Chriſtian Faith right again on its old Foundations, as it once ſtood pure. All Principles fail them in this particular. Fancy only, and nothing like a rational Proof, uphold's this charge of errour againſt our Church. <hi>Mr Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleets</hi> Aſſertions are refuted. If the Roman Catholick Church has erred by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing unreaſonable conditions, Sectaries who Profeſs themſelves fallible in all they ſay, may have erred more and ſpoil'd all they went about to mend. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more unreaſonable, then to make a few Rebellious people rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from an ancient Church firſt to accuſe it, and then to ſit judges in their own cauſe, and condemn it. None can probably ſhow, that theſe late Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of Proteſtants, who oppoſed all other Religions, are untainted, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely Orthodox. As no men before the Donatiſts made the Church ſo ſtrait as they did: ſo never Chriſtians before theſe later Sectaries made it ſo wide, as to hold in it all the Hereticks in the world. Proteſtancy, as Proteſtancy, is no Chriſtian Religion at all, if the belief of that Doctrin which is common to all Chriſtians be amply ſufficient to Salvation. Proteſtants may Anathematize all the Doctrin within the compaſs of their reformed Religion, and yet be ſaved.</p>

               <p>PRoteſtants, as they make not good their own Doctrin, by Proofs ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on certain Principles: ſo they never impugn the Roman Catholick Faith by rational Arguments.

As it is an evident Principle, that all thoſe Wife and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctors who taught Chriſtians Popery for a thouſand years, were neither fools nor perverſly blind. So it is more evident, that God ſuffered not thoſe millions of Chriſtians, inſtructed by theſe Teachers, to be groſly abuſed with fals Doctrin, whilſt there was no other Catholick Society in the world <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

All other Sectaries, who deſerted the Roman Catholick Church erred groſly: and it is improbable to think, that Proteſtants only among ſo many ſtraying Teachers, were the only priviledged people, elected by God to mend (had any thing been amiſs, in a old decayed Church, without mixture of
<pb facs="tcp:102687:284"/> errour, or marring more then they mended. Proteſtancy is unevidenced, and an improbable Religion, that is, no Religion, but a fancied opinion. No Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin fallibly taught, as Proteſtancy is, can be ultimately reſolved into Gods infallible Revelation. Scripture alone without an infallible Interpreter makes no man infallible. A Doctrin which at its firſt riſe was, and is ſtill oppoſed by all Chriſtians (excepting the Sectaries who broach it) is as improbable, as Arian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm.

Of the ſlight way of Sectaries Arguing againſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Doctrin. <hi>Mr. Stillingfleet,</hi> like his other Brethren, in a Diſcours of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, begins with Ieers, with Miſtakes, and diſſembling of Difficulties. He ſtates not the Queſtion rightly between the Latin and Greeks. The Diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Latins and Greeks is clearly laid forth by <hi>Leo Alatius</hi> a Grecian. What paſſed in the Council of Florence concerning This Diſpute. The Greeks moſt certainly, both before and after the Council held, a place of puniſhment for ſouls departed, from which place they are freed by the Prayers of the Living. They alſo hold that ſouls enioy the beatifical Viſion before the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The weaknes of our Adverſaries cauſe is beſt ſeen by a Parallel of Proofs for Purgatory and againſt it. The Catholick Principles for Purgatory. <hi>S.

When the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick explicates a dubious paſſage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He relies on a ſure Principle diſtinct from his Interpretation. Objections are Anſwered. How the Supplications of the Church reſpect mercy and Forgivenes to be ſhewed the juſt at the Day of Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement. An Objection is propoſed in behalf of Sectaries, and ſolved in another Diſcours concerning the Bleſſed Sacrament. The Grounds of our Catholick Doctrin for the Real Preſence. The contrary Opinion of Sectaries is proved to be meer Fancy. Sectaries cannot by vertue of any one received Principle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Catholick from the plain and Obvious ſenfe of <hi>Chriſts</hi> moſt ſignificant words. The Teſtimonies of Fathers are as clear for our Catholick Doctrin, as the words of the Council of Trent. A Parallel of Proofs for and againſt the Doctrin of the Real Preſence. The way of Sectaries is, chiefly to loos Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in propoſing difficulties againſt us, without caſting a ſerious thought on ſure Principles that ſolve them. They find the Myſtery of the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment uneaſy to ſenſe, but reflect not, that They believe two or three other Myſteries fully as hard, if not more difficile, for Example, a Trinity, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, and Original ſin. It is moſt Evident, what Ever Principle (whether it be Scripture, Church Authority, or conſent of Fathers) that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to believe theſe Verities, that very Principle is as preſſing, forceable and urging, yea and often more expreſs for the Belief of our Sacrament wherat they boggle.

We admit of <hi>Chriſts</hi> plain Words, according to their moſt obvious ſenſe: we find them ſo underſtood by a number of the moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable ancient Fathers, as we underſtand them, and moreover have a Learned Church that ſpeak's as both Scripture and Fathers ſpeak. Can Sectaries now exact of us that we leave theſe ſtrong Principles, and rely on their word becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe They will have us do ſo? It is impoſſible, unles They give us in lieu of the ſe, as plain Scripture, as plain Teſtimonies of Fathers, and produce the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of ſome other Church more ancient and Orthodox then ours is, that once Patronized their Novelty. If they ſay, They can explicate our Scripture and ancient Fathers. I have Anſwered above.

Obſerve my reaſon, equally Convincing in both caſes. Therfore we ſay, the Doctrin of a Jew gives<note place="margin">If you ſay the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of a Jew is not only falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but fals alſo, you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what is to be proved againſt him.</note> no Aſſurance to Him that Teaches, and thoſe who hear it, becauſe it is removed from all infallible Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and relies only on his errable judgement or Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that teaches it, but the Fallible Doctrin of theſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries now mentioned, is alſo removed from all <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Principles</hi> (for no man amongſt them can deliver Doctrin <hi>infallibly</hi>) Therfore it relies only on an er<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable judgement or fancy that teaches it, and by good conſequence, is none of <hi>Chriſts</hi> infallible Doctrin. But if it be none of <hi>Christs</hi> Doctrin, it gives no more Aſſurance to them that Hear it, than the Doctrin af a Jew gives to any of his Sect, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Here briefly is my Ground and I would ſe it Anſwered.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some perhaps will ſay, the Doctrin of theſe Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries relies on Gods Word, and that alone is a ſure and infallible Principle. I anſwer, if we ſpeak of Sectaries particular Doctrin <hi>as reformed,</hi> They have not one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle clearly, no nor ſo much as probably grounded on Gods expreſs word, for Scripture ſaith no where that <hi>Faith only juſtifies, that all Churches are fallible, that there is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102687:287"/> no Purgatory, no Sacrifice of the Altar, &amp;c. Ergo</hi> theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins want certain Principles. Now if they Reply, Though theſe particular Doctrins are not expreſs in Scripture, yet the general Truths of Chriſtianity are, And They rely on theſe, not careing for more. I Anſwer, Though theſe Verities <hi>as revealed</hi> be infallible in themſelves, yea and infallible alſo to the Catholick that admit's of them as infallible, for the certain Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his Church, yet no man, no Church, no <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Truth,</hi> ever hitherto aſſured the Proteſtant <hi>infallibly,</hi> that they are infallible (for all theſe with him are falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) therfore They are removed from the nature of being certain Principles in order to his Faith and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin alſo, unles He ſay that the Objective infallibility of Scripture is evident <hi>ex terminis</hi> to the very eyes that read the book, which is proved improbable Diſc. 1. c. 12. n. 4. Wherof more preſently. I Anſwer. 2. If the Objective infallibility of theſe great Verities be a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Principle to the Proteſtant, it either Derives into his underſtanding that teaches them a <hi>Subjective infall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> in order to his Doctrin; or leaves him as He was before lyable to miſtake and errour, if the firſt be granted; He is <hi>Subjectively</hi> infallible when He teaches, and this He will not hear of. Grant the ſecond viz. That He is lyable to miſtake and errour in his teaching, He may well miſs of the objective Truth, becauſe He only ſaith <hi>fallibly</hi> what God ſpeaks <hi>infallibly,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently his Doctrin <hi>ultimatly reſolved,</hi> ſaith no more but <hi>timidly</hi> thus much: <hi>Perhaps</hi> I declare what God ſpeaks, and it may be not, for my Declaration is <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi> and may be <hi>fals,</hi> Therfore you Chriſtians who hear me, can believe nothing <hi>infallibly,</hi> becaus my very
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102687:287"/> Teaching is doubtful, And it is againſt the nature of a doubt, to convey <hi>certainty</hi> into any underſtanding. Se Diſc. 1. c. 4. n. 7. 8. Now if you Ask why it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, though he ſpeak truth as it were by Chance, I anſwer the Reaſon is: Becauſe he hath no P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ciple which determinates his teaching to ſay that <hi>Infallibly</hi> which God ſpeak's <hi>infallibly.</hi> The External Principle of Scripture makes him no more Infallible, than the worſt of Hereticks who read it, And all other Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples He works by, are lyable to errour. And here brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you ſe the difference between the Truth of <hi>an Act,</hi> and its <hi>Certitude,</hi> The firſt only ſayes in contingent matters a <hi>conformity with the Object;</hi> The other, a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Determination to Truth by Principles not liable to errour, And Sectaries alwaies want theſe Principles, whilſt They teach a Doctrin <hi>fallibly.</hi> If here they ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke recourſe to moral certainty only and think that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, turn to the fift Chapter of the firſt Diſcours and you will ſe them evidently confuted. It is loſt labour to repeat again what is ſayd in that place.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Theſe grounds ſuppoſed, you ſhall ſe how <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> Exceptions againſt them comes to nothing. Let us ſaith He P. 9. n. 2. examin a little the ſtrength of this pretty Propoſition viz. <hi>That if we be not infallibly aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Truth of Chriſtianity Iewes, Turks and Pagans are as well perſwaded of their wayes, as we</hi> (Chriſtians) <hi>of ours. What a mad Aſſertion</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>is this, that nothing is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, but what is infallibly certain, and that there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Probabilities and Improbabilities &amp;c.</hi> To this I anſwer in a word, (you ſhall have the Reaſon hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) Nothing in true Chriſtianity is credible, but what both may, and muſt be believed by moſt certain faith,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102687:288"/> in other moral matters things are morally credible, though we arrive not to certainty, but Faith hath its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poole</hi> goes on. <hi>I am not infallibly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that there is ſuch a place as Iamaica (for it is poſsible that all Geographers may miſtake, and Travellers may lye) Therfore I am as uncertain that there is a ſea paſſage to China by the North &amp;c. I am not certain, if I find a Calf in a field, but that it may</hi> (as ſome time it was) <hi>drop't from the Clouds, but will any ſober man think that it came not from a cow?</hi> He hath other inſtances to this purpoſe, And the man (if I miſtake not) would here liken the cettainty of that Truth we have of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> to the certainty we have of <hi>Iamaica</hi> and a calf coming from a Cow, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Judaiſm He would have ſo improbable, as if one ſhould ſay, the Calf was dropt from the Clouds. In a word if He diſpute with a Jew, He will hear that his whole Diſcours is <hi>Petitio principij,</hi> and that his Inſtances of Iamaica and a calf are nothing to the purpoſe, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe he ſuppoſeth what ſhould be proved viz. That the Doctrin of a Iew is ſo improbable to that Sect, as this Antagoniſt makes it, And that the taught Doctrin of Sectaries is ſo highly Probable in order to them, as is here ſuppoſed. Alas, the Iew wil utterly ſilence <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poole</hi> with this convincing Reaſon. What ever becomes of my Doctrin, I tell you, your Proteſtant taught Doctrin which may be fals, is no better than mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, becauſe it is not ultimately reſolvable into Gods infallible <hi>Revelation</hi> which cannot be fals. That it cannot be thus reſolved is evident, becauſe a Doctrin that is fallible and may be fals (though true in it ſelf) as <hi>fallible and lyable to falſity,</hi> cannot be, as it were, caſt or laid on Gods <hi>infallible Veracity,</hi> that eſſentially Diſowns and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102687:288"/> rejects all Doctrin that's fallible, and may be fals. Therfore, <hi>as Fallible,</hi> ultimately reſolved, it muſt be brought to its one home, which is not Gods infallible Revelation, but to meer fancy, or ſome other uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For example: Put the caſe, that an Engliſh Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node truely Defines: <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> is God and man, yet ſo that the Definition by vertue of all the Principles it hath, or its own intrinſick merit, is fallibly Delivered. One reflects on this Definition and conſider's the <hi>Truth</hi> of it, which is a conformity with its object, as alſo the <hi>Weaknes</hi> of it, which is <hi>Fallibility</hi> for want of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that Determin it to Truth. I Ask now why Do Sectaries believe <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be God and man by this Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Definition ('Tis one of your Acts of Faith is it not?) You muſt Anſwer; you Believe ſo becauſe God hath ſaid it in Scripture. Very good. But I Ask again? Hath he ſaid this <hi>Fallibly</hi> by a Revelation that's capable of falſity? No muſt evidently, His Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is infinitly certain, Ergo I ſay your Definition or Act of Faith, <hi>Quâ fallibilis,</hi> or as <hi>meerly fallible,</hi> cannot under that Notion of <hi>Fallibility,</hi> reſt upon an infallible Veracity, for this infallible Veracity hath neither <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> nor <hi>Proportion</hi> with a fallible Aſſent, nor can a fallible Aſſent have any <hi>meaſure</hi> or <hi>Proportion</hi> with an infallible Revelation. Mark therfore well the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this whole Aſſent. <hi>I believe Chriſt to be God and man by a fallible Act which may be fals, becauſe Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Revelation which can neither be fallible or fals, Moves me to believe ſo,</hi> And moſt juſtly call it no Faith at all, for an infallible Revelation Moves none to believe <hi>falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> therfore the tendency of this Act, as it is <hi>Fallible,</hi> Moves forward without a <hi>Divine Motive</hi> to rely on, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102687:289"/> hitt's not upon the <hi>Strength of Gods certain Revelation,</hi> but leaves that, and runn's no man knows whither, or ſtands without any motive. You ſe therfore that Gods Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation which is <hi>infallible</hi> cannot ſupport a fallible Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and conſequently the very beſt Acts of our Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Belief are no Faith, wherof more <hi>Diſc. 1. Chap.</hi> 5. and 6. <hi>I ſay the very beſt Acts.</hi> For you may diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh two ſorts of them in Sectaries. The firſt tend to their own particular Novelties, and theſe are both fals and Fallible. The other Acts adhere to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Truths of Chriſtianity, And all theſe though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to their objects, are yet <hi>ſubjectively fallible,</hi> and conſequently have not the ſtrength of any firm or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Principle to uphold them, as you may ſe in places now cited.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But we have not yet don with <hi>Mr. Poole,</hi> there are more exceptions againſt Him. Mark his words. If ſaith He, we be not infallibly aſſured of the Truth of Chriſtianity, Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es and Turks are as well perſwaded of their waies, as we are of ours, And then Ask's <hi>what a mad Aſſertion is this, that makes no difference between Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities and Improbabilities.</hi> Now here his Inſtances follow of Iamaica and a Calf, and I think He would ſay, That the Truth of Chriſtianity is probable, and ſo highly Probable, as that there is a Iamaica, And that Iudaiſm is ſo improbable as that a Calfe found in a field, ſhould be thought to be dropt from the Clouds.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In the firſt place, we are to explicate more fully what <hi>M. Poole</hi> huddles up in theſe general Terms. <hi>The Truth of Chriſtianity.</hi> Three Things therfore may be here reflected on, which eſſentially conſtitute Chriſtian Religion. The firſt is the Object of it, which is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102687:289"/> Gods infallible Revelation. The ſecond is the matter believed by vertue of this infallible Revelation. The third is a firm act of Faith, that tends into the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the matter Revealed, upon that Devine moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve Infallibly Propoſed, And this firm Aſſent of Faith, intrinſecally Denominates all good Chriſtians <hi>Faithfull Believers.</hi> I ſay <hi>infallibly Propoſed:</hi> For if a Revelation lie as it ſometime doth dark in Holy Scripture, a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent</hi> is neceſſary, that brings it to more light, And as I noted <hi>Diſc. 1. C.</hi> 4. According to the meaſure or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres of certitude which the Proponent gives to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Revelation, An Aſſent in the Hearer followes and no ſtronger. If He only ſay probably God ſpeaks thus, The aſſent can be no more but probable, if with truth he ſay certainly, it is certain. Theſe things ſuppoſed be pleaſed to reflect once more on <hi>Mr. Pooles</hi> words. <hi>What a mad Aſſertion is This? That nothing is Credible</hi> (He means concerning the Truth of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) <hi>but what is infallibly certain, and that there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Probabilities, and Improbabilities.</hi> He would ſay, it is madnes to judge ſo, and Wiſdom to make the Truth of Chriſtianity highly Probable, and Judaiſm improbable.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Now I ſay. <hi>Nothing that eſſentially Constitutes the truth of Chriſtianity is leſs then certain, Nothing in it can be ſo meanly thought of, as to be called only probable.</hi> And firſt if we ſpeak of the Material Objects believed, Theſe Solely and <hi>Objectively</hi> conſidered (may we uſe proper Terms) are neither <hi>Probable</hi> nor <hi>improbable,</hi> for there is no Probability in Objects, every thing being what it is in <hi>its ſelf,</hi> independent of my <hi>Probable</hi> or <hi>Improbable Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</hi> No man when He ſee's the ſun ſo darkly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102687:290"/> through a Cloud, that he cannot ſay whether it be the ſun or no, yet thinks it is, Call's it a <hi>Probable ſun,</hi> the Probability is in his act that makes a judgement of it, and not in the object. Again, if we ſpeak of Gods Revelation that Aſſures theſe Material Objects to be as they are ſpoken, That very Revelation becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from an Infinit intellectual power, is properly not only infallible, but infinitly more infallible then all the words of men and Angels are, put together. And here is no place for meer probability only, though we think of the greateſt Imaginable. He therfore that Parifies the moral Certainty one hath of Jamaica, with the more then Metaphyſical certainty of Gods Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Doth not only hideoufly err, but wrongs God and his eternal verity. 3. If we ſpeak of the internal Aſſent of Faith, which Denominates us true Chriſtian Believers, and tend's into Gods infallible Revelation upon the <hi>perfection of its infallibility,</hi> as alſo into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Object infallibly revealed, This very Act goes far beyond the ſtrongeſt probability, and is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then that judgement is which men have of Iamai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. The Reaſon is. That which uphold's this act of Faith (to ſay nothing here of other principles which ſtedfaſtly fix it on Truth) is an infinite Verity, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit Objective Certitude, Contrarywiſe, that which upholds an Aſſent given to the Being of Iamaica, is only moral Certitude and may be fals, For the Act ultimately reſolved comes to no more but this. Men ſay ſo: Thoſe are living that have feen the place, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are conveyed thither &amp;c. But all theſe proofs, though moſt morally certain, equalize not the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of an Aſſent that relies on an Infinite verity,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102687:290"/> that can neither deceive nor be deceived.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Perhaps you will ſay: Though this Veracity of God be infinitly infallible in it ſelf, yet one may rely on it with an Act only Morally certain, and you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no more for Faith. I grant the caſe is poſſible, but withall ſay ſuch an Act is no Faith (as is largely proved <hi>Diſc. 1. c. 5. and</hi> 6. becauſe it is not ultimately reſolvable into Gods infallible veracity as the laſt <hi>Motive</hi> to reſt on, but into ſome other inferiour Motive extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and Diſtinct from <hi>Gods Revelation.</hi> Put the caſe, that three or four Learned Heathen Philoſophers of good repute, Aſſure one of their ſect upon their Credit and humane Authority, They cannot but judge, all things conſidered, that God hath revealed the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Divine word in Holy Scripture. Admit alſo that the Hearer, becauſe he eſteems them knowing, upright, and ſincere, yeilds his aſſent to that Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion meerly for their Authority: The <hi>Formal Object</hi> or <hi>Motive</hi> of his Aſſent is not (if the ſuppoſition ſtand) Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, for this is only yet the Material Object <hi>Believed</hi> upon humane Authority, conſequently it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an Act of Faith, For Faith as Faith, preciſely reſt's alwaies on Gods Revelation as the laſt and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Motive, without the mixture of any other. See <hi>Diſc. 1. c. 5. n.</hi> 5. 6. as alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. Now if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know more concerning the certainty of him that Propoſeth the Object of Faith darkly revealed in Holy Scripture, read the 4. Chap. of the firſt Diſcours.</p>
            <p n="10">10. By what is ſaid hitherto, you ſe (Good <hi>Mr. Poole</hi>) that true Chriſtian Religion muſt either ſignify the Objective Infallibility of Gods Revelation, or the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Faith wherby we Captivate our underſtanding,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102687:291"/> and ſubmit to an Infallible Veracity, both the one and other goe farr beyond the mean meaſure of meer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities, or the higheſt moral certainty. Therfore your Inſtances of Iamaica and a Calf are here uſeles and inſignificant. I ſay <hi>True Chriſtian Religion,</hi> or to ſpeak in your words, <hi>The Truth of Chriſtianity,</hi> For if by the <hi>eſſential Truth of Chriſtianity,</hi> you will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the prudent Motives or Inducements that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede Faith, and ſhew us where True Chriſtianity is profeſſed, and call theſe the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; know firſt you have none of them, as is proved <hi>Diſc. 1. C. 8. 9. and</hi> 10. Know ſecondly, that theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives previouſly pondered before we believe, though moſt requiſit to belief, are not the Eſſentials of Faith (whether you take Faith <hi>obiectively</hi> For the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved or <hi>ſubiectively</hi> for the Act of Belief) But objects of Science, as you may read in Chapters now Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: For Faith, which eſſentially conſtitutes Religion, follows in every good Chriſtian after the Conſideration of theſe Motives, and <hi>ſub Notione fidei,</hi> or as Divine Faith, <hi>ultimately</hi> relies not on them.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Vpon theſe Grounds all comes to nothing that you have P. 10. and 11. where you ſay: If beſides the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the <hi>Thing,</hi> there be required <hi>Certitudo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecti</hi> the Infallibility of the perſon, you will bring this fox out of his hole by a notable Dilemma. A word only in paſſing. Pray you, Sir, what's here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the <hi>Infallibility of the Thing?</hi> You either mean Gods certain Revelation and this certainly moſt infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly, is not to be called a <hi>Thing</hi> but ought to be ſpoken of with greater Reverence, or you mean (and your context bears no other ſenſe) the material Objects of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian belief, now theſe ſolely conſidered can no more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102687:291"/> be called <hi>fallible</hi> or <hi>infallible,</hi> then <hi>probable</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable.</hi> No man ſaith that a ſtone which he ſees in the high way, is either fallible or infallible, probable or improbable. The Reaſon is, Becauſe theſe Terms, <hi>certain, fallible, infallible, probable, improbable,</hi> &amp;c. note ever the <hi>tendency of vital Acts</hi> proceeding from an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual power, And therfore moſt improperly belong to objects, neither vital, nor intellectual. Thus much only by the <hi>Bye.</hi> Now to your foxing it and fearful Dilemma. Either (ſay you) <hi>a ſubjective certainty or infallibility of Belief,</hi> (mark your own words) <hi>of the Truth of Christianity is neceſſary for particular Chriſtians, or it is not. If it be not neceſſary, then Papiſts too vainly boaſt of it, and muſt Confeſs probable evidence ſufficient for particular Chriſtians, and infallibility neceſſary only for the Pope and Councel: if a ſubjective infallibility be neceſſary for particular Chriſtians, then every Papiſt in England hath a Pope in his belly, &amp;c.</hi> Here is the ſubſtance of your Dilemma, and it is a ſtrange piece of confuſed Stuff. Obſerve well. You begin with the <hi>Subjective</hi> infallibility <hi>of the Belief of the Truth</hi> of Chriſtianity, and then run further then to <hi>Iamaica,</hi> to talk of that which you call <hi>the probable evidence of it.</hi> Good Sir, <hi>the evidence of credibility</hi> belonging to true Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is totally diſtinct from the infallible belief of it. That; if we make a right Analyſis, precedes Faith, Faith followes, and is far more certain then the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, all have of the Evidence of Credibility. See Diſc. 1. c. 7. 8. 9. 10. Briefly I ſay firſt. The belief of true Chriſtianity is <hi>ſubjectively infallible</hi> in every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chriſtian, who therfore may have as ſound Faith as the Pope himſelf, or any that ſitt's in Councel. The Reaſon, already given and further declared Diſc. 1. c. 1.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102687:292"/> is thus. God an infinite Verity ſpeaks to us for this end that we believe him, He ſpeaks infallibly; Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chriſtians believe both what He ſpeaks, and (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to their power) as He ſpeaks, <hi>Ergo</hi> they believe infallibly. Again. A fallible Belief cannot be ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately reſolved into an infallible Revelation, none ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that holds himſelf obliged to Believe an infinit Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity owned as infallible, can proceed doubtfully upon that Motive, for he knowes, An infinit Verity ſpeak's not doubtfully, or opinatively. I ſay ſecondly. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Faith of the Truth of Chriſtianity is miſcalled, if you ſtyle it <hi>probable</hi> Evidence: it is not probable, but certain, becauſe it relies on an infinit Verity. It is not <hi>Evident,</hi> but <hi>obſcure,</hi> becauſe, <hi>Argumentum non appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentium.</hi> Thus much is undoubtedly true, if we ſpeak of the <hi>Aſſent</hi> of Divine Faith. Now, if when you talk of particular Papiſts haveing a Pope in their belly, you groſly Imagin that every one can <hi>Define,</hi> or Declare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly Chriſtian Doctrin in order to the whole Church, as the Pope and Councel Doe, you fight with ſhadowes, no Papiſt hold's ſuch fooleries. And by this you ſe the laſt ſtrength of your weak Dilemma brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p n="12">12. You are alſo as unlucky in your next Aſſault, where you Chalenge the whole Club of Jeſuits to Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ſolidly. By the Grace of God you ſhall have an Anſwer that will make you ſilent hereafter. Thus you go on. Were the Popiſh opinion of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches infallibility true in it ſelf <hi>certitudine Objecti;</hi> ſo alſo is the Proteſtants opinion concerning the <hi>infallibility of Scripture true</hi> in it ſelf, and <hi>certitudine Objecti,</hi> as the muſt deſperate Papiſts Grant. For they ſay the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102687:292"/> is Divine, true, and certain in it ſelf, but not <hi>quoad nos,</hi> therfore hitherto there is no difference. It is not worth the while to inſiſt here upon a Catacreſis or abuſe of words, or to ſay how incompoſſible theſe two termes combined together are in the Papiſt. <hi>Opinion,</hi> and <hi>certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Object:</hi> For Catholicks in Matters of Faith content not themſelves with a bare opinion, where the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is <hi>certitudo Objecti</hi> or Gods certain Revelation duely propoſed, that exacts from them no <hi>Opinion,</hi> but a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Aſſent of Faith, And ſo we ſay that the infallibility of the Church is a matter believed by us, becauſe God hath revealed it, conſequently its no Opinion. But Sir, this is not what I ayme at. We will hear you ſay all, And come to the ſtrength of the Difficulty. If ſay you, <hi>it be a ſufficient foundation for a Romaniſt, that He hath ſuch probable evidence of this Doctrin of the Churches infallibility, why should it not be as ſufficient a fundation for a Proteſtant, that He hath ſuch (nay infinitly more) probable evidence of the Doctrin of the Scriptures infallibility? Since the evidence of the later is granted by the Papiſts Themſelves, and the evidence of the former</hi> (that is of the Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility) <hi>not only denyed and Diſputed down by Protestants, but alſo questioned by their own Authors.</hi> You End. <hi>This Queſtion I chalenge the whole Club of Ieſuits ſolidly to Anſwer.</hi> I Anſwer very catagorically without Clubbing it, and ſay firſt. The Catholick hath more then meer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Evidence of the Doctrin of the Curches infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The Sectary by his own Principles, hath not ſo much as probable evidence of the Doctrin of the Scriptures infallibility, Independent of the Church. I ſay 2. Though the Sectary had probable evidence of the Scriptures infallibility, yet it is a uſeles book in his hands.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:102687:293"/>13. The firſt Aſſertion contain's two parts I prove the firſt. The Catholick hath a Church evidenced by Vnparallel'd Miracles, by converſions of whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from Infidelity, to our Chriſtian Verities. He hath a Church manifeſted by all thoſe other Glorious Cogniſances of Truth, which the Apoſtolical Church ſhewed to the world (not one is excepted) as is proved <hi>Diſc. 1. c.</hi> 9. 10. If therfore that Apoſtolical Church, was prudently believed to deliver infallible Doctrin (and this before Scripture was writ) by the inducements of thoſe illuſtrious marks and Characters of Truth wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was adorned, our Roman Catholick Church, that undeniably evidenceth the very like ſigns, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon that Reaſon to deliver alſo infallible Doctrin: For where there are the ſame effects and ſigns of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Doctrin, the Infallibility of it is, as it were, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by them, otherwiſe ſuch Motives would be both inefficacious and uſeles, whilſt God ſhewes them for this end, that all may give Aſſent to his infallible Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, taught by that Oracle where they evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and I believe led on by the inducements, yet muſt forſooth, only believe uncertainties, or fallible Doctrin that may be fals.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The Doctrin therfore of the Roman Catholick Church is now as well made immediately Credible by vertue of theſe Motives, as the Apoſtolical Church was, before the writing of Scripture. And Theſe Motives in order to the Learned, and thoſe who prudently ſeek for Truth, firſt and moſt immediatly Demonſtrate the Church, or Thoſe perſons that teach <hi>infallible Doctrin, by whoſe Authority we learn, what and where infallible Truth is profeſſed.</hi> That theſe marks and ſigns immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102687:293"/> to the Perſons that Teach infallibly and not to Scripture, is undoubted. <hi>Mark 16. 17. Theſe ſigns shall follow, in my name they shall caſt out Divels &amp;c.</hi> Again not only the Doctor of the Gentils. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. call's the wonders He wrought, <hi>Signa Apoſtolatus ſui,</hi> the marks of his Apoſtleſhip, but a greater Doctor alſo, Truth it ſelf <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 25. (when the Jewes would not believe him) remitted them to the evidence of his Miracles. <hi>The works which I do in the name of my Father, theſe give Teſtimony of me.</hi> And <hi>verſ. 38. If you will not believe me, believe the works.</hi> Works therfore and wonders An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the perſons, or Church that Teaches, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably induce prudent men to believe the certain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin Delivered by them, who ſhew ſuch wonders. In a word, here is all I would ſay. No Religion is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently true or fals <hi>ex Terminis,</hi> upon the bare Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Him that ſayes its true or fals, Therfore it muſt have the Evidence of its Credibility manifeſted, before Chriſtians admit of the Doctrin. But this Evidence is firſt manifeſted by ſuch ſigns and Miracles, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Apoſtles perſonally ſhewed to the world, and by vertue of them induced Aliens from Truth, to believe it as Infallible Doctrin, Therfore whatever Church ſhewes ſuch Miracles, the like ſigns and wonders as <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles manifeſted, plead's as well for the Infallibility of its Doctrin witneſſed by ſuch Miracles, as the Apoſtolical Church Did. But the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church only and no other, ſhewes theſe <hi>Miracles, Efficacy of Doctrin, Vniverſality, ſtrange Converſions</hi> and other moſt Convincing Motives. Therfore if the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians induced by ſuch evidence, firmly believed the Apoſtolical Doctrin to be infallible (which was not <hi>ex
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102687:294"/> terminis</hi> evidently infallible) we may now upon the very like Inducements (not for the inducements as the laſt Motive) Believe as ſecurely upon our <hi>Churches Authority</hi> the Doctrin taught by it, to be infallible. Deny this Evidence of our Motives, and we force Sectaries to prove the Denial by as ſure Principle, as we Aſſert them: Grant them and our Argument is concluding. And here you have more them a meer probable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Churches infallibility.</p>
            <p n="15">15. An Other Argument for it, beſides thoſe Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res cited <hi>Diſc. 2. C. 6. n.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. is not only probable, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerably Convincing, hinted at <hi>Diſc. 1. C. 2. n. 9. Chriſt</hi> as is confeſſedly granted both by Catholicks and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries, ſent Paſtors up and down the world to teach Chriſtian Doctrin, But he never ſent any to teach falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doctrin which may be fals, Ergo He ſent them to teach his own infallible Doctrin, and <hi>Infallibly.</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve it. He ſent none to teach any other Doctrin then that, which may be ultimately reſolved into Gods infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible veracity revealing Truth: But that which is ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timatly reſolved into an infallible Veracity, can neither be fals nor fallible Doctrin, becauſe God as I now ſaid, ownes no fallible Doctrin that may be fals, Therfore, this Reſolution of an Act tending <hi>fallibly</hi> into Devine Revelation, is rather Non-ſenſe then Faith. <hi>I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible believe Chriſt to be God and Man, becauſe Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Revelation will have me to believe ſo:</hi> For No Infallible Motive applyed to my vnderſtanding, as it <hi>is infallible,</hi> can draw from me a fallible belief of a Doctrin that's meerly fallible. But All Sectaries, whether <hi>Arians, Donatiſts,</hi> or <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Teach only falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doctrin, and <hi>fallibly Ex parte Docentis,</hi> Ergo they Teach not that Doctrin which <hi>Christ</hi> ſent his Miniſters to teach,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102687:294" rendition="simple:additions"/> or that can be reſolved into Gods infallible Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty revealing Truth. Yet moſt certainly, ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Paſtors by vertue of <hi>Christ Miſſion,</hi> teach his infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Doctrin Infallibly, and theſe are the Paſtors of the Roman Catholick Church, who only lay claim to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility and prove it alſo, as the Apoſtles Did by the Antecedent Evidence of thoſe Motives, which the Church ſhewes and manifeſteth to the world, as is now Declared. I chalenge <hi>Mr. Poole,</hi> directly and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagorically to Anſwer this my Reaſon (without talking any more of Clubbs, or running into Generalities) and in as few clear words as I Deliver it.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Now to prove the other part of my Aſſertion. <hi>Viz. Sectaries by their own principles have not ſo much as a probable Evidence of the Scriptures infallibility, without Church Authority?</hi> Here is my principle. The infallibility of Scripture which contains many Difficulties, tell's ſtrange ſtories, and <hi>ſeemingly</hi> often ſpeak's contradictions, is not by <hi>it ſelf or own light,</hi> ſo evidently Credible to the Eyes of a Reader, as the infallibility of the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Church was evident by <hi>Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Converſions</hi> to the Primitive Chriſtians, who believed it infallibly: At leaſt S. Auſtin judged it not ſo Evidently Credible, when He ſaith, <hi>He would not believe the Goſpel unles the Authority of the Church moved him to believe it.</hi> The Infallibility of it therfore, muſt by proved by ſome good Principles extrinſick to Scripture, but the Sectary hath not one ſound Principle, Diſtinct from the Tradition and Authority of the Church wherby this Infallibility is proved, Therfore Scripture in order to Him is not ſo Infallible, as the Church is to the Catholick. If any Deny my principle, and make the Scriptures <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:102687:295"/> Diſcernable by its own <hi>light,</hi> by the <hi>Majeſty, of the ſtyle, purity of its Doctrin,</hi> or efficacy it works in the minds of thoſe who read it &amp;c. I think there are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Demonſtrations againſt the Paradox: For as I noted <hi>Diſc. 1. C. 2. 12. n.</hi> 4. Two things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in Scripture, firſt, the <hi>exteriour Syntax</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the words, and ſo much preciſely is not the Scriptures total Infallibility, which ſayes more beſides that exteriour language, and neceſſarily implies A <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Act</hi> a <hi>Volition,</hi> or <hi>Decree of God,</hi> wherby the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giographers that writ the words, were infallibly aſſiſted, and determined to record truth, and nothing but Truth, Now this Divine <hi>Volition</hi> or Decree becaus it is eſſential to God, and therfore no other but God Himſelf, can be no Object of our ſenſes, when we hear or read Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Conſequently it is to be Diſcovered by a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours grounded on Principles, diſtinct from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward letter of Scripture, wherby we may come to a ſure Evidence of its Infallibility, not at all yet within the reach of our ſenſes, And this no Sectary can do, as I ſhall preſently make Evident.</p>
            <p n="17">17. I ſay Therfore, if the Motives now alleged for the Churches Infallibility, as <hi>Converſions, Miracles Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality</hi> &amp;c. induce not immediatly to believe that Church they demonſtrate to be Infallible, much leſs can the exteriour words or ſintax of Scripture, be a fit <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> to Convince any of its Infallibility. And to prove this, beſides what is often noted in the Treatiſe, Chiefly <hi>Diſc. 1. C. 8. n.</hi> 7. Ill here only Propoſe two Queſtions, The firſt: Whether if <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Iohn,</hi> who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly Aſſiſted, had not recorded that ſhort ſentence in His Goſpel: <hi>The Word is made flesh,</hi> but ſome other not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102687:295"/> infallibly Aſſiſted by the Spirit of God, had written the very ſame Verity, as it were by Chance: My Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion I ſay is, whether the Sectary that now reads this ſentence in <hi>S. Iohn</hi> Goſpel, can more Diſcover an <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility</hi> in it by force of the outward words, then if they had been Caſually written by one without Infallible Aſſiſtance? I think He will not dare to ſay yes, or if He Do, I'll urge Him to prove it by Principles, when the outward words are the Very ſame in both Caſes, and in like manner clear to all that read them. My ſecond Demand may yet perhaps better evidence what I ayme at, and is thus. Suppoſe that our Sectaries ſhould put the book of <hi>Ecleſiastes,</hi> which they hold Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, into the hands of twelve learned Gentile Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and with it the book of <hi>Wiſdome</hi> or <hi>Ecleſiaſticus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, not held Canonical by them: Suppoſe again, They deſire theſe learned and diſinterreſſed men, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to read theſe three books, and after the reading Sincerely to tell them, which of them hath Gods Spirit in it, or contains <hi>his infallible Verities,</hi> For, this may be eaſily gathered by the very natural evidence of what they read, by the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of the ſtyle, <hi>Efficacy</hi> of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king which appears Clearly enough in the outward let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Thus much don, ſeperate theſe Philoſophers, by four and four, into three Companies, put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three different cells, much after that manner, as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſay, the ſevently Interpreters were ſeparated. Let them with all ſincerity read, examin, and peruſe theſe Books, and if when the work is ended, they unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly accord, that a greater Divinity, a ſtronger <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> appear's in the ſong of Salomon, then in the other two books, we will ſay ſomething is proved, and hold
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102687:296"/> it as ſtrange a Miracle, as that which <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> recounts of the 70. Interpreters. Now if Any tell us, this light of Scripture, though ſufficient in it ſelf, is not evident to every one that looks on it, becauſe the blindnes or perverſnes of mens minds may keep them from the Diſcovery of it: The Reply hath no place here, for we ſuppoſe firſt, theſe Philoſophers to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interreſſed, learned, upright and ſincere, as well in their reading, as in the judgement they give of it, And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly we will ſuppoſe, that all thoſe are not blind whom Sectaries make blind, nor only thoſe quick ſighted (I mean themſelves) whom they will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve ſo.</p>
            <p n="18">18. To theſe Queſtions I add one more, it may paſs for an Argument <hi>Ad hominem</hi> againſt Sectaries, who hold all the Definitions of our Church, even when they are true, to be yet fallible. I Ask, whether theſe Quick ſighted men are able to Diſcern the <hi>Fallibility</hi> of theſe Definitions, by force of the outward words therof only, as they Diſcover the infallibility of Scripture by the Majeſty of the ſtyle, and outward Sintax. And mack where the force of the Difficulty lies. As <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> neceſſarily implyes Divine <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> in order to the Truths Delivered in holy Scripture, ſo the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Fallibility of</hi> the Churches Definitions, implyes a want of that Aſſiſtance in order to thoſe Definitions. I Ask therfore, whether as the firſt is Diſcernable and viſible enough to their Eyes, by the very context of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward letter, They will conſequently grant, that the other alſo is as clearly viſible, and Diſcernable by the very words of the Definition? If They Anſwer, yes, Firſt they need not hereafter to impugn the Churches
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102687:296"/> Definitions by any other <hi>Medium</hi> but this, that they are without further proof by themſelves <hi>evidently fallible:</hi> So much is ſaid by them, and it proof enough. 2. They may as well ſay, They know when a man tell's a lye, and this by force of his very ſpeaking, as that they know the ſuppoſed <hi>Fallibility</hi> of the Churches Definitions by her ſpeaking: For, if their eyes can Diſcern the want of Divine Aſſiſtance in the one caſe (which real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is not wanting) they may more eaſily Diſcern the want of Truth in the other (which really is wanting.) And if this be not a Paradox, there was never any in the world. Now contrarywiſe, if they cannot Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Churches ſuppoſed <hi>Fallibility</hi> in her Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions meerly by her Exteriour words, becauſe that is a thing inviſible, I would gladly learn how They come to know the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of Scripture by the words Therof, for that is as much (if not more) inviſible, and as far removed from our eyes and ſenſes.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Some, who pittifully ſuppoſe, Scriptures to be proved <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible</hi> by the very light which is in them Object firſt. When we ſee the ſun, and the vaſt extent of the light it has, we may well infer it comes from that luminous body, And may we not (ſay Theſe) proportionably inferr, from the <hi>clearnes, Greatnes, Majeſty,</hi> and <hi>Coherency</hi> of thoſe <hi>Truths</hi> revealed in Scripture, that they muſt certainly come from none but God? Anſw. What will not men ſay at laſt, who dare Propoſe ſuch evident improbabilities? Why, the whole world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in this that the light comes from the ſun, for it is evident to our ſenſes, but do all unanimouſly agree about the very Canon of Scripture, or the clearnes of thoſe books all admit of, which are evidently obſcure
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102687:297"/> in a hundred paſſages, and ſo ſeemingly incoherent in many other places, that it is mighty Difficile to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them? Again. What more <hi>Greatnes</hi> or exteriour <hi>Majeſty,</hi> can any Diſcover in Salomons Proverbs, then in the books of Wiſdom and Eccleſiaſticus, or in tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe two pious Hymns <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and <hi>Gloria in Excelſis?</hi> ſuch arguments therfore are not only ſlight, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable.</p>
            <p n="20">20. They Object 2. The works of Creation Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence Gods Wiſdom Power, and Greatnes. <hi>Ergo</hi> God can give as great evidence of a Revelation. Anſw. I grant He can do ſo, But What then? Doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that He hath don it <hi>de facto</hi> by the words internal to Scripture (which is here only to the purpoſe?) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the light of orher Motives, as Miracles, Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and the like, which as I now ſaid, immediately manifeſt the Church, and not the book of Scripture.</p>
            <p n="21">21. They object 3. No other way is conceivable, that it ſhould be evident that a Doctrin comes from God (and conſequently is infallible) but that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains things highly <hi>ſuitable to the Divine nature,</hi> things above the <hi>finding out of human reaſon,</hi> things only tending to Advance <hi>Holines</hi> and <hi>Goodnes</hi> in the world, And this Doctrin to be Delivered by perſons, who wrought Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrallel'd Miracles. And They ask, whether all theſe be not in the moſt evident manner <hi>Imaginable</hi> contained in the Doctrin of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and in the <hi>books of Scripture?</hi> I Anſwer firſt: The Opponent is far from Conceiving any thing like a probability in this Objection. For, if it be evident that a Doctrin comes from God, and therfore is infallible, becauſe it contains Things ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Devine Nature, the very Gentils without
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102687:297"/> other Motives ſhould as well ſee this Evidence, as we ſe the light of the Sun. Now if you ſay its an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, but not perceptible by all you runn into Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Deſtroy the Nature of Evidence, and make it now evident now unevident, when, and to whom you pleaſe. If again you ſay its an Evidence ſufficient to breed Faith, you beg the Queſtion and ſpeak impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably for nothing can beget Faith but what is owned for Gods infallible Word upon prudent Motives, and the Teſtimony of ſome Infallible Oracle. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what is here ſaid, I Ask whether if <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles had appeared in the World, and only preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the high Myſteries of our Faith as a <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, Original ſin,</hi> with other Doctrins now regiſtred in Scripture that advance Holines of life &amp;c. But all this without doing one Miracle, Converting one Nation, or ſhewing any the leaſt wonder, that they were ſent from God, to teach as they did. My Queſtion I ſay is, whether upon this ſuppoſition, either Jewes or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils would then have believed them or could have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered an <hi>Infallibility</hi> in a Doctrin thus Orally Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, or writ in patchment meerly by the force of the words. If Sectaries ſay <hi>Yes,</hi> They do not only ſpeak a Paradox which no Chriſtian ever uttered, and make our Saviours Argument Againſt the Jewes (<hi>Si opera</hi> &amp;c. If I had not don works amongſt them which no other did they would not have ſin) null and inefficacious, but moreover are convinced by this clear proof. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, (And it implies no impoſſibility) that God, who hath yet within the vaſt reach of His <hi>Omniſciency,</hi> a Thouſand other Verities unknown to the world, and not at all revealed in Scripture, or Delivered by the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102687:298"/> Church (for certainly He hath not revealed all He knowes) ſhould now both inſpire, and Aſſiſt twelve poore Fiſhermen, to preach infallibly theſe Truth never heard of before, yet ſo, that they <hi>Teach</hi> only, but do no Miracles, work no Converſions, ſhew no wonders, and give no other Teſtimony of their being ſent from God, but by their own bare word. Would any men in the world, think ye, prudently believe them meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their preaching, or would Sectaries as well Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Infallibility of theſe Verities taught by their preaching, as they now Diſcern the Scriptures infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility? No, the whole world would prudently ſet light by ſuch Doctrin, though in it ſelf, both Divine and Infallible for want of prudent Motives to make it evidently Credible, and ſo all would have don, had the Apoſtles only preached the Divine Truths already regiſtred in Scripture, without further Motives. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more is required to prove that a Doctrin comes from God, then thus much only, that it contains <hi>in it ſelf</hi> things highly ſuitable to the Divine nature, things above the finding out of humane reaſon, and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceing to piety. I ſay <hi>in it ſelf</hi> for if we goe to a ſtrict Analyſis of the Scriptures Verities, we are not to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as the Opponent doth, but to prove, that all theſe Verities <hi>are ſuitable to the Divine nature,</hi> which both Jewes and Gentils Do Deny, And therfore muſt be further proved.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Now if on the other ſide They grant, and moſt truely, that none would have Diſcovered any Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in Apoſtolical Doctrin without further evidence of Miracles, of ſigns, and wonders, we have our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: For it followes inevitably, that Scripture cannot
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102687:298"/> be Diſcovered to be Divine by it ſelf, nor <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lble,</hi> by vertue of any light contained in the words, or Sintax therof. It followes 2. that <hi>Mr. Stillingfleet</hi> is more then a little out, in his ſeventh Interrogatory <hi>part. 1. Chap. 7. p. 230. fine,</hi> where He Ask's <hi>whether it be not the higheſt Diſparagement of this Divine Doctrin to make it ſtand in need of an Infallible Testimony of any,</hi> that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Catholick Church? Good Sir reflect. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Motives of Credibility manifeſted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Apoſtles, their Miracles, Converſions, Sanctity &amp;c. taken purely as Motives previous to the Faith, of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe who believed, were either fallible or Infallible (take whether ſide you will:) <hi>If Infallible;</hi> you evidently ſee that moſt certain Doctrin ſtood (without Diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) ſo far in need of thoſe Inducements, that it would never have been believed without them (as is already proved) though moſt infallible in it ſelf. If you hold thoſe previous Inducements to be only Fallible, you muſt yet Grant, that the belief of that Apoſtolical Doctrin ſtood ſtill in need of them without any Diſparagement. Therfore much leſs doth the Teſtimony of an Infallible Church Evidenced by the like Motives, Diſparage it. I ſay <hi>the Teſtimony of the Church Evidenced by clear Motives:</hi> For as the learned <hi>Snares</hi> Obſerves 3. Par. Tom. 2. Diſp. 31. Sect. 2. n. <hi>Dico<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Majora horum facient,</hi> that they ſhould do
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102687:299"/> greater wonders. Therfore other Principles (and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne could be more ſtrong then <hi>Chriſts</hi> own Teſtimony) beſides His Miracles, were neceſſary to beget certain Faith of his Godhead in Believers: And ſo we ſay, The Teſtimony of the Church, Evidenced by ſignes and wonders, is alſo neceſſary to beget a full Aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the Scriptures Infallibility, without it we have no Divine certainty of Gods Word.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Now I return a ſecond Anſwer to the Objection, and ſay: A perſon that is not infallible can ſpeak of things ſuitable to the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and <hi>above the reach</hi> of humane reaſon, of vertue and Godlines &amp;c. For not only the book of <hi>Herman,</hi> or <hi>Hermes</hi> Called the Paſtor, highly valued of by ſome Ancient Fathers, but other writings alſo, though untruely aſcribed to the Apoſtles, often ſpeak <hi>Divinely;</hi> yet never were admitted by the Church as Canonical, or Gods <hi>Infallible</hi> word. Nay more. Some parts of the Goſpel, and the Epiſtles of <hi>S. Iames</hi> and <hi>S. Iude</hi> alſo, were not for a time recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as Canonical by the Ancient Church, though they ſpak then as Divinely, and were as Inſallibly Gods word, as they are now, the Ancient Church, that had eyes as good as Sectaries red them, yet Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no <hi>Infallibility</hi> or Divinity in them upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that they ſpak of things ſuitable to the <hi>Divine nature.</hi> And who ſees not, but that the books of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Ecleſiaſticus,</hi> contain as high Doctrin, as Divine Precepts, as are in Salomons Proverbs, or <hi>Ecle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtes,</hi> yet the later are Divine with Sectaries, and the former not? And here I would willingly learn, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the firſt Proteſtants that admitted of the later, and rejected the Other as Apocryphal, did ſo, becauſe they ſmel't, as it were, a Divinity in thoſe they received by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102687:299"/> the very reading, and not in the former? I am ſure, the more learned Proteſtants give other Reaſons. For theſe grounds therfore I ſay, the Argument above is ſo unreaſonable, that I wonder men of judgement Ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to propoſe it. Now if they believe the Scripture to be Infallible, becauſe of the Miracles and other wonders, <hi>internal to the book,</hi> wrought in confirmation of its Doctrin. Make a right <hi>Analyſis,</hi> and Ask, why they believe theſe Miracles to be Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Scripture, and follow them cloſely till they come to a <hi>Propoſitio Quieſcens,</hi> or an undoubted Principle? And you'l find the very Reaſon returned you, to be the thing in <hi>Queſtion:</hi> Although we granted (which is not true) that Scripture it ſelf ſaid, all things contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the book are infallibly Gods Word, For it would be demanded a new, How They know, that very Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion to be Scripture.</p>
            <p n="24">24. For theſe Reaſons ſome Sectaries will ſay, The Scriptures infallibility is to be proved by Diſcours, not grounded on the meer <hi>light,</hi> or <hi>Majeſty</hi> therof, but by probable Principles extrinſick to it. And here is one Argument. We know by humane Authority Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally certain, that Scripture was writ by holy men, Prophets, Euangeliſts, and Apoſtles. I anſwer, we know not ſo much of all the books in Scripture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Churches Teſtimony. For it is doubtful who writ the books of <hi>Ioſue</hi> and <hi>Iudges,</hi> and it is ſtill in Controverſy, whether Salomon writ the Proverbs, and therfore, ſome, not only Catholicks but Sectaries alſo, are of opinion, that if we rely on humane and hiſtorical Authority only, we have greater and more particular Aſſurance, that <hi>S. Thomas,</hi> for example, writ his ſumm
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102687:300"/> of Divinity then we have Aſſurance of the particular Authors, of no few books in Holy Scripture. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, though we had this certainty grounded on Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, yet no man among Sectaries (who ſay all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches erred before <hi>Luther</hi>) can tell us, upon moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, whether the firſt Authentick Originals, were afterward Corrupted or no, by Ancient Hereticks, and the <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> erring Church of Rome. Se more of this ſubiect <hi>Diſc. 2. C. 2. n.</hi> 7. 8. Others again may Argue, from the Miracles wrought by Scripture immediatly, And one was, as Baronius recounts, that this ſacred book in <hi>Diocletians</hi> time being caſt into the fire, the flames were forthwith extinguiſhed. I Anſwer firſt, both this and other Miracles, were only wrought in the true Church, and at moſt prove (which is to be noted) that the book is true, pious, and holy, but is far from Convincing that (we now only inquire after) which is its <hi>infallibility.</hi> For, God might have don the like Miracle for a true Chriſtian Catechiſme, Had <hi>Diocletian,</hi> who deſired to raſe out all memory of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, caſt that into the Fire alſo. Others argue from the Accompliſhment of Propheſies, which proves little, without the Teſtimony of the Church. Firſt becauſe the very Propheſies, and the fulfilling of them, muſt be proved to be Divine Scripture, and this cannot be don, abſtracting from Church Authority. 2. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe two things are to be diſtinguiſhed: A power <hi>to Propheſy,</hi> and to write, as Hagiographers Did, <hi>Canonical books.</hi> One may propheſy, who only heares from a Prophet what was told him, upon the Prophets own Authority, but none can write <hi>infallibly</hi> Canonical books of Scripture, but ſuch as have immediately the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102687:300"/> of the Holy Ghoſt to direct him. In a word, here is the laſt and moſt true Reſolution of all theſe Difficulties. Unles Sectaries rely on our Churches Teſtimony for the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of Scripture, they are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently beaten out of all likelihood of other Principles, wherby to prove it is infallible. Yet this very Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Church in order to them, doth little or nothing, for reaſons clearly alleged Diſc. 2. C. 2. n. 6. 7. It is needles to repeat them in this place.</p>
            <p n="25">25. And it is as needles to prove my ſecond Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion above n. 12. Which is. <hi>Though Sectaries had Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Evidence of the Scriptures infallibility in general,</hi> yet that doth them no ſervice, becauſe it is a uſeles book in their hands. This Propoſition is ſo Copiouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in the ſecond Diſcours C. 1. and 2. Where much is ſaid of Sectaries endles diſſentions, concerning the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of Scripture (though admitted of as Divine) that no Unorthodox man ſhall acquit Himſelf of the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, there propoſed. All I'll do now (Though it hath not been my Cuſtome to tire the Reader, with long Authorities of Ancient Fathers) is to mind him of one only <hi>Tertullians</hi> Teſtimony, in his book <hi>de Praeſcriptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus adverſus Haereticos cap.</hi> 19. His words are. <hi>Ergo non ad Scripturas provocandum eſt: nec in his conſtituendum cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamen, in quibus aut nulla, aut incerta victoria eſt.</hi> (Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galtius read's, <hi>par incertae, aut parum certa) Nam etſi non evaderet collatio Scripturarum, ut utramque partem ſiſteret, ordo rerum deſiderabat illud prius proponi quod nunc ſolum diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum eſt, quibus competat fides ipſa cujus ſint Scripturae, à quo, &amp; per quos, &amp; quando, &amp; quibus, ſit Diſciplina, quâ fiunt Chriſtiani. Vbi enim apparuerit eſſe veritatem diſciplinae, &amp; fidei Chriſtianae, illic erit veritas Scripturarum, &amp; expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionum
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102687:301"/> &amp; omnium traditionum Chriſtianorum.</hi> The ſenſe of this whole ſentence is this. We are not therfore to appeal to Scriptures, nor are our debates to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined here, wherin there is no victory, or a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain one. For although there were no Collation, or comparing of places together, that might ſtay the two Advers parts, yet the order of things requires this to be firſt propoſed, which is now only to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed <hi>viz.</hi> To whom the Faith appertains, wherof the Scriptures are. From whom, and by whom, when, and by what Perſons, that <hi>Diſcipline is,</hi> wherby they were made Chriſtians. For where there appeares the Truth of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> (that is as <hi>Macereus</hi> and <hi>Pame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> interpret, the <hi>Rule</hi>) and of Chriſtian Faith, there you ſhall have the Truth of Scriptures, the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it likewiſe, and of all Chriſtian Tradition. Obſerve well. The whole context of theſe words ſaith firſt, that debates can never be ended by Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re only. 2. That before we Diſpute by Scripture, we ought to know, and by other Reaſons, who thoſe are to whom Scripture belong's. 3. That where the Diſcipline, or Rule of Chriſtian Faith is previouſly known, by other grounds diſtinct from Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there you have the True Interpretation of Scripture, and all Chriſtian Tradition. After a full ponderation of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe words, I leave any man to Judge that loves Truth, whether that Doctrin be not here moſt remarkably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, which is taught and mantained, by the Roman Catholick Church.</p>
            <p n="26">26. <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Poole</hi> from his 12. page to his 37. hath no work for me, for his whole ſtrain is to run on in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and finding fault with ſuch Arguments of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102687:301"/> as He forſooth, judges inefficacious to prove the Churches Infallibility, whereas God knows, Had He had where withall to do it, He ſhould have gon a contrary way, and proved poſitively by <hi>Scripture, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> the Churches <hi>Fallibility,</hi> but Herein He is ſilent, becauſe in real Truth He hath nothing to ſay. The ground of the Churches Infallibility, which <hi>Mr. Poole</hi> never toucheth on, is briefly hinted at abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve <hi>n.</hi> 15. and further laid forth <hi>Diſc. 1. c. 1. and</hi> 2. and I deſire an expreſs Anſwer to it. Now and then He hath ſomething againſt the Writings of the Ancient Fathers, who with him are fallible, becauſe they ſpeak of the Churches Infallibility, and the good man never reflect's, that he and his little book, are far more fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. I wave ſuch trifles.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Page 37. He begins with his Diſtinctions of the Judge and rule of Faith, and ſaith firſt: The ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream and truely Infallible Judge of all Controverſies is God and <hi>Christ.</hi> Very Good, but nothing is yet Done, unles you fallible man can ſay, in all the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between us, what God and <hi>Christ</hi> ſpeak, what is judged for you, and againſt us, which is ſo far from being a Truth proved, that in Every Controverſy it is the very thing in Queſtion, and meerly ſuppoſed by you, without either Proof or Principle. You ſay again. The External and political Judges, to wit the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church, are ſubordinate to the ſupream Judge. Anſw. Very true. But what then? Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry this followes, that if they really contradict the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judges ſentence, They muſt give their ſubjects leave to argue, whether it be right in the ſight of God. Hold Sir a little. If you rationally contradict them,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102687:302"/> you muſt firſt prove your ſelf wiſer then theſe ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Judges are, and Evidence their Errours by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Principles, which is impoſſible. For either theſe Judges are Infallible, or fallible, if you grant the firſt, you cannot rationally contradict them. And if they be fallible: How dare you a private fallible man ſpeak contrary, when your very Contradiction is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then their oppoſite Aſſertion is, I mean <hi>purely</hi> and <hi>poorly</hi> Fallible? In a word without any certain Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to rely on (which you ſhall never have) you too boldly take leave to oppoſe your Judges, and make your ſelf a Rebel by it. You ſay 3. There is in Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Perſon a ſecret Judge, which is called Reaſon, or Conſcience. I muſt Ask once more, what then? Have not <hi>Arians, Pelagians, Quaquers,</hi> and all other Sectaries reaſon, as well as you? What ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Inſtrument of reaſon can apprehend, judge, and work in you after your faſhion, it doth the like in theſe other, after Their faſhion. Do you not therfore ſe how little you advance your cauſe by talking of your Reaſon, which, unles it be Evidenced by ſure Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to be better then that of your Adverſaries, proves juſt nothing; And add what private <hi>Spirit</hi> you pleas to help your Reaſon out, They will talk as much of their contrary Spirit, to help theirs. Theſe two points are ſo largely declared, and proved <hi>Diſc. 2. c.</hi> 5. that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve your Anſwer to them will prove unreaſonable.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Page 40. You goe firſt very warily to work for no man knowes what you would ſay. Then you are manly reſolute in your Deciſions. <hi>We willingly ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledge</hi> (ſay you) <hi>and reverently eſteem the true and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Governors of the Church, orderly aſſembled and proceeding regularly in Councels, whoſe deciſions are to be highly valued

A word now to your reſolute Definitions. You ſay firſt, this Judge of the Church is not infallible, but ſubject to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Anſwer. And ſo are you, Sir, alſo fallible when you oppoſe your ſelf to the Judgement of a Church, whether it be your own Engliſh Church, or the Roman Catholick: If therfore the Judgement of both Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were ſuppoſed fallible (as the one is not) your ſingular Judgement is no more but fallible alſo, and what gain you by that? Thus much only: You Contradict the Church fallibly, and the Church again Contradicts you fallibly, and thus you may remain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting one another to the Worlds End, without the Deciſion of one Controverſy, unles you make it Evident by undoubted Principles, that you are to judge the Church when you pleaſe, and the Church is not to medle with you, or your Iudgement. You ſay 2. this judge of the Church being ſubject to hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher Authority, and tyed to a higher rule, if its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions be Manifeſtly repugnant to that <hi>Superiour Rule,</hi> they are not to be obeyed.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102687:303"/> ſuppoſe what ſhould be proved. <hi>Viz.</hi> That the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the true Catholick Church, which is ever aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by the Holy Ghoſt, can be tepugnant to any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Rule, and therfore touch not Catholicks in the leaſt manner. But if you ſpeak of the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of your Engliſh Church, which (becauſe falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) may be repugnant, you licenſe your ſelf by your own Principles, to diſobey it, And look you to that. You ſay. 3. <hi>The judge is Conſtituted by God in the Church, not for the Command of mens Conſciences, but for the regulation of their Actions, and Preſervation of peace in the Church, which is not Violated by mens inward and unknown Sentiments, but by their External demeanour, and ſenſible Effects of them.

And had we no more to ſay, but thus much, that Scripture proves nor it ſelf <hi>to be Infallible</hi> it were enough.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102687:304"/> Gloſſes are to be ſtood to, contrary to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a learned Ancient Church? Hence I ſay, you talk at random, when page 48. you tell us. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is enough delivered in Scripture by which all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies might be ended, would men be humble, ſtudious, and Self denying. Lay your hand on your hart, and ſpeak your conſcience, can you judge this to be true? Or can you perſwade your ſelf, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne are to be found within the limits of this Ancient Church as humble, as learned, and ſtudious as a few Miniſters are in England? Why vent you ſuch Paradoxes without proof, or ſo much as a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility? You ſay again page 48. after ſome parergons of conditional, and abſolute power, That if the Church be ſufficient to end all Controverſies, becauſe all muſt ſubmit to its decrees and Doctrin, the Scripture in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke manner, may be ſaid to be ſufficient, becauſe all are obliged to ſubmit to the Decrees and Doctrin ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. I Anſwer all are to do ſo, when they know by an infallible Interpreter what the Scriptures Teaches, but this in controverted matters, is ever the difficulty. You ſay it ſpeak's one thing, and we ſay the contrary, therfore Scripture alone, which is as ſilent now, as it was Sixteene ages ſince, is a leſs meet Meanes to end theſe Contentions. Contrariwiſe, the Church propoſeth all ſhee teaches with the greateſt clarity, and if any doubt occurr, is ready, able, and ſufficient to declare it ſelf further, Scripture that hitherto never ended any difference between us, cannot do ſo.

The Spirit of God is the Eye-ſalve that annoints your Eyes, and inables you to ſee the Rule. 4. The Church is the Interpreter (but not infallible and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick) the witneſs, or guardian of this Rule. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve well. We have here a number of words, but No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing proved, Nothing ſo much as cleared. Say ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore plainly: What tradition is it, that conveyed to you the books of Scripture? Moſt ſurely, it is the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Roman Catholick Church, for you have no other. If therfore, you dare truſt this Church in a matter of ſo weighly importance, as to hand to you Gods Sacred Word, you may as well, and with as good Conſcience, believe what ever other Doctrin it Teaches by Tradition. See <hi>Diſc. 2. C. 2. n.</hi> 4. 5. You talk ſecondly of Reaſon, that ſee's this Rule of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and you certainly mean the <hi>true ſenſe</hi> of it, or you ſay nothing. Now I would willingly learn, how your Reaſon comes to have the priviledge, or prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of knowing ſuch Secrets, before your elder Brethren the Papiſts, or your more neerer Allies the Quaquers, or the old Arians? The like doubt I mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve about the Eye-ſalve, that annoints your Eyes, you call it the Spirit of God, And I am ſure there is no <hi>Donatiſt,</hi> or <hi>Pelagian,</hi> but will ſay as much of his contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Spirit. But above all Satisfy me in one doubt, and plainly point me out the Church that interpret's Scripture as you do in all thoſe matters of Controverſy now between us? I tell you Sir: There was never any ſuch Church in the world fallible or infallible, that favours your gloſſes and interpretations of Scripture.</p>

               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:102687:305"/>32. Page 46. You have a Fling at the Captains Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt the <hi>judgement of Reaſon,</hi> who, if you relate truely, (for I have not now his Epiſtle by me) ſaith firſt. Reaſon muſt ſubmit to the judge, therfore it is not the judge. You Anſwer. <hi>It is not the ſupreme judge, but ſubordinate, and tyed to Rule. Contra.</hi> Every judgement with you is fallible, and may eaſily Swerve from the rule, or miſtake the ſupreme judges Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: if it do ſo, it is erroneous and not to be followed. Say therfore, who ties your judgement that is fallible, and may be fals, to any <hi>certain Rule?</hi> This ſhould be Anſwered.</p>
            <p n="33">33. He Objects again. The judge muſt be Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, but reaſon is fallible, <hi>Ergo.</hi> You Anſwer: <hi>The Maior is a pittiful Petitio principij. Contra.</hi> Your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply is more pittiful. Obſerve well. All judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, you ſay, are fallible, and many are not only fallible; but fals alſo. Moſt ſurely, you will not have us to follow any fals judgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet we muſt follow a fallible judgement. Vouchſafe, to tell us, whoſe fallible judgement we are to truſt to, in theſe weighty matters of Controverſy? And I have all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be ſatisfied in the doubt, becauſe it avail's me Nothing, to know that I muſt rely on a fallible judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which may be fals, <hi>Vnles you teach me whoſe fallible judgement it is,</hi> I am to rely on. For example: When you interpret a paſſage of Scripture contrary to the Churches Senſe, your explication is fallible. Anſwer therfore, why will you rather have me to reſt on your judgement that is fallible, then on the Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſenſe, though it were falſly Suppoſed fallible? If you ſay, All things conſidered, your explication is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102687:306"/> more probable, you are the very man, that pittifully begg's the Queſtion, and ſpeak's without any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Principle.</p>
            <p n="34">34. Now, if wearied with thoſe Interrogatories, you ſay roundly (and this muſt be anſwered in your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple) that every man is to follow his own judgement, in theſe debated matters: The <hi>Arian</hi> is to follow his private judgement, the <hi>Socinian</hi> his, the <hi>Quaquer</hi> his, the <hi>Donatist</hi> his &amp;c. you do not only licenſe all the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks in the world, to remain ſtill in their Hereſies, But moreover Counſel them to believe Falſities, for you know, or ſhould know, that theſe private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are all fals. If finally you Anſwer: We muſt reſt on a judgement that is <hi>True,</hi> although it be fallible, I know not what you mean, for no man amongſt you, can aſſure me in theſe high points of Controverſy, when a judgement is to be reckoned of as true, that is falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe Truth is moſt eaſily ſeparated from an <hi>Act,</hi> that is really <hi>Falli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p n="35">35. In a word, Sir, your whole Miſtake lies in this. You ſound not to the bottome, the ſignification of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe words. The <hi>Iudgement of Reaſon.</hi> For <hi>Reaſon</hi> in this place, cannot be taken, for a weak Diſcours, or the private Sentiment of every erring man, after He hath humm'd over, or paus'd on Scripture (the <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian,</hi> will make his Religion good this way) but the <hi>Iudgement of Reaſon</hi> Goes further, and ought to be <hi>deeply rational indeed,</hi> that is: It muſt reſt at laſt <hi>upon a ſolid and ſatisfactory Principle, which throughly pondered,</hi> work's powerfully upon every prudent diſintereſſed Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and gently forceth the man, that layes prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce aſide, to acquieſce and yeild, without fear or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102687:306"/> The Catholick Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> only, moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently propoſeth theſe undoubted ſatisfactory Principles, wheron a rational judgement doth reſt ſecurely, when the Faith Shee holds, is reſolved. No Sectary ever yet ſhewed, nor ſhall hereafter ſhow, any think like a Satisfactory Principle, to ground a rational judgement on, when He believes contrary to this Church. All he can do is to tell us, what <hi>He thinks,</hi> but you ſhall never learn from him, upon any ſolid Principle, extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal to his own boſome thoughts, <hi>That God ſpeaks as He thinks.</hi> But I have ſaid ſo much of this Subiect <hi>Diſc. 1. c. 7. n.</hi> 4. 5. and <hi>Diſc. 2. c. 5. n.</hi> 8. 9. 10. that it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les to add More.</p>

Sir, if you underſtand not, you want cords to tye faſt withall, and therfore may eaſily not cloſe, with the ſupreme judges ſentence. But of this we have ſaid enough already. You will find the ſubſtance of what followes in your Appendix refuted upon ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the Treatiſe. Had I more time, I would ſay a word to your Gloſſes upon theſe two places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture quoted by you. In the firſt, though <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſaith contrary 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. that Scripture is difficile to be underſtood, you will have it eaſy, unles it be to the ignorant and ungodly: and 'tis likely you ſuppoſe, there are none of theſe ignorant or ungodly people among
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102687:307"/> you. Upon the other Text 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. 16. you ſeem to inferr, from the Vtility of Scripture, a <hi>ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> in order to Saluation, which is as good an Inference as if you ſaid: Your head is profitable to make you to live, therfore it is ſufficient. Or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Principles of Philoſophy can inſtruct you to learn Divinity, <hi>Ergo</hi> they make you a perfect Divine. Sir, the general Truths contained in Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe they teach us to believe the Church, Tradition and other Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Doctrins, orally delivered, are in this general way, able to make us wiſe to Saluation, but none can ſo much as probably draw from hence, that all things in particular, neceſſary to Saluation, are explicitly ſet down in Scripture. Every Catholick Writer that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicates the Text, ſhewes your Deductions to be weak, and unconcluding. That work therfore being don to my hand, I end, wiſhing you much Good, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happines.</p>
